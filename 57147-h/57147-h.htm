</div>

<p class='c003'>Scott Burton sat on the porch of the
little cabin on the edge of the forest and
looked absently out across the wide beach
at the restless waters of the Gulf of Mexico. No
one ever would have guessed from his expression
now how crazy he had been to see that gulf only
the day before. He apparently did not see the
water at all. The big waves boomed on the
beach unheard and even the little oyster schooner,
which glided across the picture on its way to port,
failed to catch his attention. He had sat motionless
for so long that a great big fox-squirrel,
afraid but drawn on irresistibly by his curiosity,
had crept nervously up within a few feet of him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly Scott shook his head to rid himself
of a bothersome fly and the frightened chatter of
the squirrel as it whisked behind the nearest tree
broke the spell. He gave the intruder a quick
glance and turned his attention once more to the
open letter which he held in his hand. He had
read that letter dozens of times, in fact he knew
every word on the typewritten page by heart, but
he read it again now in the hope of finding some
additional meaning between the lines.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>“Your remarkable work in cleaning up the
trouble with the sheepmen on the Cormorant
Forest last summer has led us to select you for
some special work of a rather delicate character
on the Okalatchee. There have been some timber
thieves at work on that forest for some time, and
so far our officers have been unable to catch them
or effectually put a stop to their work. It will be
your particular duty to see that these thefts are
stopped and the trespassers brought to justice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In order that you may have ample authority,
you have been appointed deputy supervisor under
Mr. Graham and will be given every possible assistance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will report directly to this office.</p>

<p class='c008'>No, he could not see any more in it, and yet it
seemed mighty little to tell a man who had been
looking forward to that letter for a week and had
traveled two thousand miles to get it. He turned
the paper over thoughtfully as though he hoped
to find some further instructions on the back of
it, and then proceeded to review once more the
whole situation.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had been fortunate enough to earn considerable
distinction in Arizona, where he had been
working as a patrolman, by clearing out a gang
of grafters who had been running sheep on the
Forest without a permit. This achievement had
won for him the chance of an appointment as a
ranger, but he had asked for the opportunity to
obtain a little more experience as a patrolman
before taking up a more responsible position.
His request had been granted and he had spent
the summer very profitably on the district he had
cleaned up so creditably in the spring.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly, without the slightest warning, he had
received a telegram from the Washington office.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Report Okalatchee, Fla., at once. You
will find instructions there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He had become attached to the Southwest and
had looked forward contentedly to a permanent
location there, but he was possessed of even more
than the usual young man’s love of travel, and
Florida had always been a country of his dreams,
a country of fairy tales that he had hardly even
dared hope to see. The sudden realization that
he was actually going there had driven everything
else from his mind, and an hour after he
had received the message he was in the saddle
on his way to town.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was only when he was on the train speeding
across the vast expanse of Texas, with plenty of
opportunity to think, that he had begun to burn
with a consuming curiosity to know what his instructions
would be. The longer he had traveled
the higher his air castles had grown and the more
anxious he had become to see those instructions.
By the time he had reached New Orleans he was
in such a hurry that he could hardly enjoy his
ten-hour wait there, though it was the first
southern city he had ever been in and a place
which he had always longed to see.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sight of the tall palmetto palms and the
moss-covered live oaks drove his imagination to
even more fantastic efforts, and finally arrived in
Okalatchee he had almost run directly from the
train to the postoffice to get those precious instructions.
And this letter was all that he had
found. He had found that the supervisor’s headquarters
were five miles away through the pine
woods and the telephone gave him no answer.
He had hired an old negro to drive him over.
There was no one there, but the door was not
locked and he had decided to stay there till some
one came. He was not much better off than before
he had obtained the letter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” Scott thought, “there is nothing to do
but wait till the supervisor turns up,” and he proceeded
to investigate his new surroundings.</p>

<p class='c004'>The little three-room cabin, built of rough lumber
with battens over the cracks, was exactly like
numbers of other ranger cabins he had seen, but
its location had been selected with more than the
usual attention to beauty and comfort. It nestled
just within the edge of a very dense stand of tall,
longleaf pines and the little front yard ran out
to meet the broad sand beach. Flowerbeds of
hibiscus and groups of oleanders lined the walk
of crushed oyster shells, and plants with which
Scott was entirely unfamiliar were scattered
around in great profusion on either side of the
cabin. It seemed to Scott as though a woman
must have planned it all, for he could not imagine
a man taking so much pains with the decoration
of his home. He found himself thinking that it
was no wonder this fellow had not caught the
timber thieves.</p>

<p class='c004'>Just to the west of the cabin a little creek
bordered with titi and sweet jasmine wandered
slowly out to meet the blue waters of the Gulf.
It could not always have flowed as slowly as it
did now, for some time in the past it had built
quite a little delta which extended out in the form
of a miniature cape, and was covered with a
grove of tall, stately palmettos. Far out from
the shore a long line of low-lying sand islands
broke the horizon. It was certainly an ideal spot.</p>

<p class='c004'>The interior of the cabin was quite as tastily
equipped as the exterior, and the cupboard
seemed to be stocked for a long siege. There
was nothing lacking even to the luxuries. Scott
smiled as he thought of his own bare little shack
high up in the southern Rockies with the round
bullet hole in the windowpane.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t care if that sissy supervisor does not
show up for a week,” Scott grunted contentedly
as he settled down in a comfortable steamer chair
on the porch. No one could have asked for a
better place to wait. But Scott was not much
given to idle comfort, especially when his curiosity
was aroused, and it usually was aroused
about something. Just now he was almost wild
to know something more of this new problem
which he had been given to solve. He watched
a little flock of sandpipers run along the smooth
beach a way, following the very edge of a wave,
but long before they had turned the point of the
little palmetto cape he jumped restlessly from
the chair and went into the cabin to study a map
which he had noticed hanging on the wall.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a detailed map, showing the irregular
boundary of Okalatchee forest and the different
types of timber. It was a great sprawling tract
of a million acres extending along the gulf to
the river on the west, to the farm lands on the
east, and north to the big swamp. It was covered
with unfamiliar terms he had seen in books,
but which had never seemed real to him before.
He had always read them before as he would read
the names in a fairy tale, and here he was in the
very midst of them: pine ridge and cypress
swamp, hardwood bottom and gum slough, low
hammock and baygall, high hammock and cane
break, turpentine orchards and stills.</p>

<p class='c004'>He marveled at the great number of ridges
shown in that flat country, and the many long,
stringlike swamps which paralleled the river and
the coast. And he wondered where in all that
maze of unknown country the timber thieves
whom he was supposed to catch were working.
He noted several ranger stations shown on the
map and wondered whether any of them were
connected with the mystery as had been the case
in the sheep business in the West, or whether
there were really any thieves at all. He remembered
reading a story in which men had been convicted
on circumstantial evidence of stealing a
raft of logs, and it was not till they had served
a month in jail that the raft had been found in
the bottom of the pond where it had been tied.</p>

<p class='c004'>If only the supervisor, or any one else who
could tell him anything about it, would come.
He had not liked the “gum-shoe” game as he had
called it when he had been obliged to try his hand
at it in the West, but he found himself eager to
get at it here because other men had tried it and
failed. It seemed to him like a challenge and he
was eager to accept it.</p>

<p class='c004'>He pored over the map, studying the lay of
the land and letting his imagination run wild.
He had caught those thieves in forty different
ways in at least a dozen different parts of the map
when the failing light warned him that it was
time to get supper and prepare for the night.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had no instructions or invitation to make
use of that cabin or the supplies in it, but there is
a certain freemasonry among the men of the
woods which was invitation enough for him. He
had no hesitation in spreading his blankets on
one of the beds and ransacking the cupboard for
his supper. There was plenty to choose from
and the wood was laid in the stove ready for the
match. In half an hour he was sitting down to
his lonely meal.</p>

<p class='c004'>But it was not destined to be a lonely meal.
Scott had hardly finished what he probably would
have called his “first course,” when he heard a
light step on the shell walk, a thud or two on the
porch, and a man loomed big in the doorway.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Scott’s first impression was that this was
the biggest man he had ever seen. He
almost filled the doorway and the crown
of his Stetson brushed the frame. His keen eye
took in the interior of the cabin in one swift
glance as he entered and then focused steadily on
Scott, who had risen smiling to greet him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Burton, I presume?” he said, smiling
pleasantly and extending a cordial hand. “My
name is Graham. Glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am afraid that I am trespassing on your
property, your provisions and your good nature,”
Scott explained, “but I did not know what else to
do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wasn’t anything else to do,” Mr. Graham
said as he hung his hat carefully on a nail. “If
you have just cooked supper enough for three I
shall not say a word.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott involuntarily glanced toward the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Graham noticed the look. “Oh, there isn’t
anybody with me,” he laughed, “that’s just the
way I feel. Had lunch with a cracker to-day.
Maybe you don’t know what that means yet, but
you soon will.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I wasn’t expecting two men to supper,”
Scott laughed, “but I think there is plenty for all
three of us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott started to get another cup and plate, but
Mr. Graham had already gotten them for himself
and took the seat opposite. He had never
seen a man who looked more like his ideal of a
woodsman, or one whom he had liked better at
first sight. They had not been together five minutes
and yet Scott felt as though he had known
this big man for months.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had word from Washington that you would
be down here,” Mr. Graham explained, “but I
did not know just when you would come. I had
a trip to make and thought I would get it in before
you arrived. Found out at the postoffice
that you had beaten me to it. What do you think
of my hang-out here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s a wonder!” Scott exclaimed enthusiastically.
“I was just thinking before you came that
I would not mind waiting here for you for a week
or two.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Graham was evidently pleased with his
enthusiasm. “Don’t blame you, I feel pretty much
that way myself. I ran on to it by chance one
time and it took my fancy so that I decided to fix
it up for my summer headquarters. I like it so
well now that I stay here nearly all the time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“<i>You</i> fixed it up?” Scott exclaimed incredulously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure,” the big fellow grinned, immediately divining
his thoughts. “Thought some woman did
it, did you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott admitted it rather sheepishly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” Mr. Graham confessed, “I am somewhat
of a lady myself when it comes to a love of
flowers and beauty. I dawdle around out there
in the yard a good share of my spare time. Not
many ‘movies’ around here to distract a fellow’s
attention.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And so they talked till the meal was finished,
the dishes washed, and the dishrag hung on its
proper nail; for Mr. Graham was as orderly in
the house as he was in the yard. Then they settled
down in the steamer chairs on the porch and
gazed in silence for a few minutes at the line of
islands shimmering in the moonlit bay. It was
like a scene from a fairy tale.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Graham broke the spell with a sigh. “I
could look at a thing like that all night, but I suppose
you are burning up to know something of
this peculiar job to which they have assigned
you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott admitted that he was rather curious.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I’ll try to tell you the whole story. The
trouble started about two years ago. The Quiller
Lumber Company had bought a big bunch of pine
and cypress timber up near the edge of the big
swamp. They are a small concern and do not
have a very large crew. Of course, that means
slow work and easy checking for us. Their slowness
came to be a standing joke with the ranger
up there who looks after the scaling. He used to
say in his diary every now and then, ‘Quiller got
down another tree to-day.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“They had been at it about six months when
the foreman came down to see me. ‘Have you
noticed anything peculiar about our scale?’ he
asked. ‘Noticed there has not been much to scale,’
I told him. ‘That’s just it,’ he said, ‘checked up
on the stumps any?’ I explained to him that we
seldom did that till a considerable quantity had
been cut.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Well, I have,’ he said, ‘and more than half
of the stuff we have cut <i>ain’t there</i>.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“He went on to tell me that he had had a night
watchman on the boom for two weeks and tried
in every way to check the thing up, but the logs
kept disappearing just the same. A lot of his
niggers got superstitious about it and quit the
job.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How do they handle their logs?” Scott asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Skid them down to the edge of the big swamp
on high wheels and shove them into a bag boom.
Then they raft them and float them out into the
river.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do they keep them in the boom long?” Scott
was thinking again of the story of the sunken
logs.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, they are not in the bottom of the swamp
if that is what you are driving at. Murphy has
prodded the bottom of that pond with a pike pole
a dozen times.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is there a channel through to the river or can
they take them out anywhere?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve hunted all over there myself and I cannot
find a place where they could take them out
except through that one channel.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose you have had that channel
watched?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Watched, I had Murphy hidden up there on
a point of land for a month and the logs disappeared
out of the boom right along just the
same.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you sure that Murphy is all right?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Murphy, why, he thinks more of the Service
than the Secretary of Agriculture does. No, sir,
it is not graft, I am sure of that; but I would give
a good deal to know what it is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do they disappear before or after you scale
them?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did go both before and after. We scale them
all in the woods now before they put them in the
boom, but they are going out of the boom just
the same.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a long pause while both men
frowned unseeing across the beautiful lagoon.
Scott was thinking of the ranger who had been
the leader of the sheep gang in the West and wondering
how he could best get a check on Murphy.
Mr. Graham had long ago gotten past the point
where he could think about it logically at all.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Has the thing been going on ever since?”
Scott asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“For two solid years,” Mr. Graham answered
peevishly. “I have put about half my time on
the pesky thing and Murphy hangs around there
like a baited bulldog. The foreman is almost
crazy about it. He has all but accused the
‘’gators’ of eating the logs.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose they take some rafts out occasionally?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure. They have been taking them out right
along. Have speeded up considerably during the
past year.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ever check up the delivery of those logs?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Many a time, and so has the company. Check
to the dot with the scale in the rafts.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you are scaling in the woods you are getting
paid for all they cut, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, the company is paying all right. They
howl and checkscale a lot, but they pay.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then why is the Service interested in it?
They are not losing anything by it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, they are not losing anything on this scale,
but it is hurting our other sales and giving the
forest a bad name. We do not like to have a
thing like that going on under our very noses.
Besides, it gets on a fellow’s nerves. I tried my
best on it. Hated to give it up, but had to confess
myself licked at last. Then I asked the office for
help and you are the result.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Some result,” Scott grunted. “I am not a
professional detective. I just stumbled on to that
sheep graft out there by chance, and now look
what it’s gotten me into. I had never been to
Florida and was glad enough to come down, but
there is a fat chance of my solving this mess. It
looks about as clear as mud.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s about the way it looks to me,” Mr.
Graham nodded, “about as clear as mud. But all
of us here are hypnotized now. We have been
mooning over the thing so long that we cannot
see straight any more. We may be walking all
over some clue which will be perfectly clear to a
stranger with an unfogged mind. Don’t give up
before you start, man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not giving up,” Scott exclaimed, “far from
it. Now that I have come all the way down here
I simply have to put the job through, but I’m
going to steer clear of these detective jobs in the
future. They are too uncertain. Too much depends
on luck.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, here’s wishing you luck,” said Mr. Graham,
rising; “we’ll give you all the help we can,
and grunt for you. Let’s go to bed, and to-morrow
we’ll ride out and have a look at the
arena.” He paused for a moment at the porch
railing. “Isn’t that fine? You can just imagine
old Ponce de Léon threading his way along that
beach looking for the Fountain of Youth four
hundred years ago, and I’ll bet he stopped and
sampled that very creek.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This historical touch gave the country a new
interest to Scott.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Scott and Mr. Graham had an early
breakfast together.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose there is no use in asking a
man from the West if he rides?” Mr. Graham
laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not much,” Scott replied. “If a man lives in
that country he has to ride. It almost broke my
heart to leave my saddle horse behind, but the
‘super’ there seemed to think that I would be
transferred West again and would not be here
long enough to make it worth while to ship him
East.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Humph,” Mr. Graham growled, “judging
from my own experience you will be grayheaded
before you catch those thieves. Well, I have two
ponies here and you can use one of them. He’s
not the best in the world, but I guess he’ll do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott was glad to find the western stock saddle
in use here instead of the English saddle he had
been used to in his home in Massachusetts. The
man who has once become familiar with a stock
saddle wants no other. The pony, too, though
far from the equal of the big black stallion he
had bought from Jed Clark, was a very good one.
It was easy to see that Mr. Graham was a connoisseur
in more things than cabin sites and
flowerbeds. Everything he owned was of the
best.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll take a run up around the cuttings first,”
Mr. Graham explained, “have lunch at the turpentine
camp, and come back by the river. That
will give you a pretty good idea of the whole forest
and show you just how the land lies. Then
you can study the thing in detail at your leisure
and tackle it any way you please. I’ll help you
all I can but I have failed at it too often to have
any advice to offer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll probably need all the advice I can get
whether it is any good or not. I certainly have
no ideas about it now, but there cannot be much
wrong with seeing the country first.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Their road—it was little more than some winding
wheel tracks—lead through a rather thin
stand of tall, yellow pines which were straight and
smooth as telegraph poles with only a few flat
branches near the top. In places there was
scarcely any underbrush on the ground, only a
few stray spears of wire grass and a thin layer
of dead needles which scarcely covered the white
sand. Here and there were large patches of scrub
palmetto, just leaves three or four feet high growing
up from the snakelike roots which seemed to
lie almost on the surface of the ground. With
the exception of these palmettoes it did not look
very different from the pine forests of the Southwest
with which Scott was so familiar.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where are all those ridges which are marked
on the map hereabouts?” Scott asked, as he looked
curiously at the level country. So far he had seen
no sign of a hill.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is one of them,” Mr. Graham laughed.
“Doesn’t look much like the ‘Great Divide,’ does
it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t get you,” Scott said, still scanning the
country.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, you see this country is all made up of
strips of swamp and strips of dry land. The dry
land is often not more than two or three feet
higher than the swamp, but it is called a ridge just
the same. Must seem a little strange to a man
from the mountains.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Just ahead of them appeared a solid bank of
dense underbrush, all woven together with climbing
vines which arched the road like a gateway.
The road dipped slightly under the arch where
the ground was black and damp, but rose quickly
and was almost immediately out in the open pine
woods again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That,” Mr. Graham explained, “is a baygall,
and this is another ridge. Always be careful how
you try to ride through those baygalls where there
is no road, they are sometimes very soft and even
if they are not you are more than apt to hang
yourself in those vines. They have yanked me
out of the saddle more than once.”</p>

<p class='c004'>For two hours they rode through this fascinating
country of alternating swamp and pine flats
without seeing any one or any sign of human
habitation. It seemed to Scott even more deserted
than his own wild, rocky mountains.
They ducked through a little baygall and suddenly
came out on to an open ridge from which
all the timber had been cut. A more desolate-looking
place Scott had seldom seen. Every
stick of timber was gone and under the Forest
Service regulations the slashings had been burned
so clean that the ground was perfectly bare. The
low stumps stood out like tombstones in a cemetery.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are approaching the haunted grounds
now!” exclaimed Mr. Graham. “This is where
Qualley is cutting and over yonder in that swamp
lies the enchanted pool where all those logs have
so mysteriously disappeared.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They could hear the sound of axes now and the
darkies laughing and shouting at the mules.
Soon they overtook the strangest-looking rig that
Scott had ever seen. It looked at first like two
great wheels rolling along the road alone, but
as they drew closer he could make out a pair of
mules ahead of them and three long logs hung on
chains underneath. He had read of these “high
wheels” (they were actually eight feet high), but
these were the first he had ever seen. A darky
was sitting on the long tongue singing light-heartedly
and punctuating his song with entirely
unnecessary shouts at the patient mules. When
he saw the riders his shiny black face broke into
a broad grin.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Whatever crooked work is going on around
here,” Mr. Graham remarked soberly, “these
darkies are not in on it. They are always as
jovial in their welcome as that fellow there and
they are scared to death of this pond.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Or they are good actors,” Scott said. He
was unwilling to except any one from his suspicion.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Graham shook his head. “Of course, you
are right to suspect everybody. I was just expressing
my own convictions. A white man can
act scared pretty well but when a nigger turns
gray he <i>is</i> scared.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A little farther on the logging road ended abruptly
at a rough log dock on the edge of a pond.
It was unlike any other log pond which Scott had
ever seen. It was in reality an arm of the big
cypress swamp. Great churn-butted cypress
trees rose queerly out of the water around it’s
edges. They were bare of leaves, but their limbs
were draped with great festoons of Spanish moss.
A number of long pine logs, some loose and some
bound together into rafts, floated quietly on the
black waters. Around the head of the pond directly
opposite them and back a way from the
water were the crude board shacks of the logging
crew.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a dull, gray day and the whole scene presented
a gloomy enough picture.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So this is the haunted pond?” Scott asked
eagerly, as he took in every detail of the surroundings.
“It sure looks it to-day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, this is the place, but it has had me baffled
for so long now that I am not sure whether
it is haunted or enchanted. Seems sometimes as
though it must be enchanted.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They sat their horses and gazed at the pond
in silence for several minutes. Mr. Graham had
stopped even thinking about the possible solution.
Scott was studying all the details of the
layout. This was the place where his problem
must be solved and he wanted to be familiar with
every foot of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s that?” he asked suddenly, pointing at
a bunch of brush near the opposite side of the
pond.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Graham studied the clump carefully and
made out the outline of a man half screened by
the foliage. Even as they looked the form melted
away.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come on!” Scott called as he spurred forward.
“Let’s ride around there and see who that is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They dashed wildly around the end of the pond
on the trail which the logging teams had made.
It could not have been much more than a minute
till they had reached the point opposite the clump.
There was thirty feet of water between it and the
shore, and it was screened quite as thoroughly on
this side as on the other. They examined it minutely
but found no sign of life.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You stay here and watch it while I go get a
boat,” Mr. Graham suggested. He rode back toward
the shanties and Scott kept his eyes glued
on the spot where he had seen that mysterious
figure.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before Mr. Graham had ridden fifty yards a
shrill whistle arrested him. Scott turned quickly
at the sound and saw a man walking leisurely
toward him along the edge of the swamp. Mr.
Graham rode back again to join them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thought you had him that time, didn’t you?”
grinned the newcomer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure did,” replied Mr. Graham good-naturedly.
“Was that you out there on that
stump?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The man grinned again and nodded. Scott
thought that he looked a little ashamed of his
discovery and studied him suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What made you beat it when you saw that we
had spotted you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I did not want to wave because I did
not want those other fellows to know that I was
there. I knew you’d come whooping around here
to have a close look, so I slipped out and came
along the shore to meet you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pardon me,” exclaimed Mr. Graham, noting
the curious glances the two men were casting at
each other. “I had forgotten my manners.
Murphy, this is Mr. Burton who has been sent
down here by the office to solve this log-stealing
mystery. Murphy is the ranger in this district,”
he explained to Scott, “and can probably tell you
more about this thing than anybody else.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The two men shook hands and Scott found himself
looking into a pair of clear, blue, unfaltering
eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I ought to be able to tell you something about
it,” the ranger admitted doggedly, “but I can’t
tell you a blamed thing. I’ve sat on that stump
out there till I’ve worn it smooth, but I have not
found out a thing. Not a single thing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ever watched at night?” Scott asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Day <i>and</i> night,” he replied. “Watched out
there all one night without seeing so much as a
bubble on the water, and in the morning Qualley
reported another bunch of logs missing. Gone
right from under my nose.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott looked mystified but said nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m showing Mr. Burton the layout to-day
and letting him get the general run of things.
Going over to the turpentine camp for lunch and
have to keep moving. You will help him all you
can if he wants you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You bet I will!” Murphy exclaimed enthusiastically.
“I’ve had my try at it. Now I’d like to
see how somebody else goes about it. Call on me
any old time,” he called to them as they rode
away.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Funny place for him to be,” Scott commented
after a long silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The thing is getting on Murphy’s nerves,”
Mr. Graham laughed. “It would not surprise
me much to find him in the bottom of that pond
in a diving suit. He wakes up in the middle of
the night and sneaks over there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott did not say any more about it, but he decided
to keep his eye on Murphy. There might be
more than one explanation of his interest. At
least he would bear watching. They rode in silence
for some time, each absorbed in his own
thoughts. All traces of the big swamp were far
behind them and they were once more on the open
pine ridges.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>At first Scott did not notice any difference
between this forest and the one they had
traversed earlier in the day; he was too
busy thinking of that enchanted pond, but he
soon realized that there was a difference. There
was a little earthen flowerpot hanging near the
ground on the side of each tree. On some of the
larger ones there were three or four of them.
For three or four inches above each cup the tree
was scratched as though some great bear had
been sharpening his claws there. These scratches
were very regular and there was exactly the same
number above each cup. At the bottom of the
scratches and draining into the flowerpots were
two little tin gutters stuck into slits in the tree.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott knew that they must be in the turpentine
orchard. It was the first one he had ever seen.
He was very curious to know all about it, but he
did not want to appear too ignorant. “Is this a
very large orchard?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“About twenty crops,” Mr. Graham answered
absently.</p>

<p class='c004'>That meant over two hundred thousand cups
and it seemed to Scott like an enormous number.
It did not seem possible to take care of so
many. It was not long till they saw a darky in
overalls and undershirt shambling about from
tree to tree.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ever seen them chip?” Mr. Graham asked,
suddenly realizing that it must all be entirely new
to Scott. Scott admitted that he had not.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They are pretty clever at it,” Mr. Graham
continued, riding over to the darky, who greeted
them with a pleased grin. “Show us a good
one now, Josh. This gentleman has never seen
it done.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There is nothing that a darky likes better than
showing off an accomplishment to a stranger.
He was carrying a heavy iron, weighted with a
ball at the lower end and bent into a loop of sharpened
steel at the top. He gave this instrument a
fantastic flourish, leaned down over a cup, and
with a few deft strokes cut a new scratch in the
outer wood of the tree, perfectly straight and
overlapping just a little the streak below it. He
repeated the operation on the other side of the
cup and straightened up with another grin.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pretty good!” Mr. Graham exclaimed approvingly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Couldn’t beat dat one, boss,” replied the darky
with a chuckle.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Been over to the pond lately, Josh?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who, me? No, suh, you don’t ketch dis heah
niggah hangin’ roun’ deah. Dat eah place
hanted, boss, sho nuf hanted. Dey tell me you
kin put a log in de watah deah and see it ’solve
smack befo’ yo’ eyes.” And his own eyes rolled
strangely and showed a broad expanse of white.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sounds bad,” said Mr. Graham, laughing as
he turned to ride away. “No danger of his stealing
any logs out of there,” he remarked to Scott
when they were out of hearing. “Looked easy
enough to see him cut that streak, didn’t it? Try
it yourself once. It would take you ten minutes
and then it would look like beaver work. That
man has to make the rounds of his crop every
week; over three thousand streaks a day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Just twenty men were putting two streaks a
week over each one of those two hundred thousand
cups. It seemed marvelous to Scott. In
another place he saw a man with a large wooden
bucket and a paddle going from tree to tree,
emptying the cups. He emptied his bucket into
barrels beside the road and a wagon collected
the barrels. Scott could not help thinking what
a glorious fire there would be if it ever got started
in all that resin.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before long they came in sight of a group of
rough board buildings strung along the road like
the main street of a small town.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That,” Mr. Graham explained, “is the still.
The darkies and their families live in those little
board shacks pretty much as they used to in slavery
days. The company keeps a store here for
them, the superintendent lives in that house next
to the store and the still is down at the other end
of the street. It’s quite a town. They will use
this camp for their turpentine operations for
thirteen years and then log for three years more.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Slovenly negro women, many of the older ones
smoking pipes, gazed at them from the doorways,
and shiny black pickaninnies rolled the whites of
their eyes in awed attention as they passed. Near
the store they met Mr. Roberts, the superintendent,
coming home to dinner. He acknowledged
Scott’s introduction very effusively and promptly
invited them both in to dinner. His wife was of
the cracker type and looked old at thirty-five.</p>

<p class='c004'>In spite of the man’s cordiality Scott did not
like his looks. He had a sallow, malarial complexion,
shifty eyes and loose-knit, gangling build.
There was a hard, cunning look about his mouth,
and he wore a large revolver very conspicuously
on his belt. Scott had the feeling that he was
being very narrowly watched, but whenever he
looked at Mr. Roberts he found him deeply absorbed
in something else. They finished their
salt pork, hominy and grease-soaked beet greens
in comparative silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Reckon maybe you’d like to see the still if
you are new to these parts,” Mr. Roberts remarked
to Scott.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” Mr. Graham answered for him, “we
both want to see it. I never get tired of hearing
that old still growl.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They walked down the street a little way to
the still. It was not a very imposing-looking
building. A roof set on posts over a copper still
which was built into a brick firebox. There was
a platform at the side on which the crude resin
was unloaded from the wagons and dumped into
the retort and a shed on the other side where the
turpentine was stored. Sitting on the ground and
a little apart from the shed was a small army of
rough barrels full to the top with solid resin.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Graham explained the process to Scott.
“You see they dump the resin just as they bring
it in from the woods into that retort and heat it.
The turpentine is boiled out and goes out of that
little pipe at the top in the form of gas. Then
they run the pipe down through some cold water
and the gas condenses into liquid turpentine which
they put into those tight barrels. When it makes
just the right noise they pour some water into
the retort to help the process along. Is she pretty
near ready to growl, George?” he called to an
old darky who was tending the retort.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ought to be pretty nigh, boss,” the old man
grinned. It was evidently a familiar question for
which he was listening and it tickled him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“When all the turpentine has gone off they
pour the resin into those rough barrels,” Mr.
Graham continued. “It hardens so quickly that
the barrels do not have to be very tight. They
put them together right here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is that all they have to do to get the kind
of turpentine that is used in paint?” Scott asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, some of it is redistilled and refined a little
for certain uses but much of it is used just so.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They walked around the place a little and Scott
learned many interesting facts about the turpentine
industry. There was a lot more he wanted
to know but the old darky called them excitedly.
“She’s startin’ to howl, boss.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They hurried over to the still and could hear a
peculiar growling sound coming from the retort.
“That’s the stuff,” Mr. Graham chuckled. “Now
listen to her when the water goes in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The water was poured in and the roar was up to
expectations. “That makes her talk,” Mr. Graham
laughed. “Now we might as well be going.
She won’t growl again for a long time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dat’s right,” the old darky chuckled. “Won’t
be nuffin’ mo’ fo’ yo’ to heah for some time.” He
fully appreciated Mr. Graham’s joke of hearing
the old still growl.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Roberts walked back to the house with
them to get their horses. “See anything suspicious
at the pond this morning, Mr. Burton?” he
asked casually.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no, nothing except Murphy,” he added
with a laugh. He said it as carelessly as he
could, but he watched Roberts keenly. He felt
somehow that this sallow cracker was surely connected
with the pond mystery and he wanted to
see if the mention of Murphy’s name as a suspicious
character would affect him. If it did,
he did not show it. He seemed to have asked
the question simply to make conversation and
only grinned at Scott’s answer.</p>

<p class='c004'>As they were mounting Mr. Roberts pulled his
revolver and carelessly shot a toad which was
hopping across the road some fifteen yards away.
“Getting near pay day,” he said in explanation,
“and I have to get in practice.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Possibly it was nothing more than the natural
temptation for a man with a gun to shoot any
live thing he sees, but Scott, with his intuitive
dislike of the man, felt sure that it was meant for
a warning display of his skill with a gun and he
thought about it in silence on the ride home
through the whispering pines.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The next morning Scott started out early.
He went alone, explaining to Mr. Graham
that he wanted to scout the big
swamp and see if he could find any clues. He
did not know what they would be but he felt
that it would be impossible to hide anything out
in the open pine country, and that the key to the
mystery must be somewhere in that gloomy
swamp. He had studied the map thoroughly the
evening before and had made an outline tracing
of the swamp to carry with him. Armed with
this map and a consuming curiosity he set out
on foot for a point on the river where Mr. Graham
assured him he would find a small bateau.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a bright, sunshiny morning when he
started, but even before he reached the river the
wind changed to the south and a dense fog rolled
in off the gulf. In fifteen minutes the water was
dripping from the trees as though from a heavy
rain. The effect was almost weird. The trunks
of the trees immediately around him were plain
enough; at fifty feet they looked like ghosts. He
walked in that little circle of forest and felt like
a man in a cage. New trees loomed out of the
fog ahead, stood boldly out as he passed them,
and were quickly swallowed in the shroud behind.
The trunks seemed to run up into the
very sky and the tops were lost to view. It was
Scott’s first experience with a real fog and he
realized how easy it would be to get lost.</p>

<p class='c004'>By keeping a careful watch he finally succeeded
in locating the trail to the river and had no difficulty
in finding the bateau just where Mr. Graham
had told him it would be. It was a peculiar-looking
craft twelve feet long and two and a half
feet wide in the middle. It was even narrower
at the ends which were square like a barge. It
was flat-bottomed and fully deserved the description
of “tippy” which Mr. Graham had given it.
There was a rough, home-made paddle beside it.
Scott was used to handling a canoe, but he found
this new boat far crankier than anything he had
ever seen before. It seemed to lurch sideways
without the slightest provocation. In the first
mile up the river he came within an ace of upsetting
a dozen times. Gradually he learned the
balance of it and got along pretty well. It did
not seem to draw any water at all. Mr. Graham
had said that it would float free on a light dew.</p>

<p class='c004'>Toward the middle of the morning the fog
burned off and the skies were clear once more.
The shores were low and fringed with heavy
brush, back of which was a strip of mixed hardwood
forest made up mostly of hickories, oaks,
and gums. It reminded Scott of the tropical stage
settings he had seen at the theater. Now and
then a little green heron or a big hooper crane
would flop silently off an overhanging limb and
disappear lazily around a bend in the river. Once
he thought he saw the eyes of an alligator sticking
out of the sluggish water, but they sank silently
before he could make sure. Gray squirrels
were scampering all through these hardwood
trees, but they, too, seemed to be utterly silent.
Scott felt like one of those old Spanish explorers
who had made their way through that same country
almost five hundred years before. It did not
seem as though things could have changed much
since then.</p>

<p class='c004'>Three miles up the river the east bank melted
away and the big swamp began. This was the
place which Scott had come to explore. He
turned the bateau and paddled out of the river
into the swamp. The break in the bank was only
a narrow one and beyond the passage the strip
of hardwoods continued as before, but it was a
very narrow strip and back of it as far as the
eye could see the swamp ran parallel to the river.
The timber was almost as heavy here as it was
on the dry land, but they were the great gaunt
cypress trees instead of the hardwoods. The
cypress is the largest tree east of the Pacific coast
forests, and there in the gloom of the swamp
decked out in the great festoons of Spanish moss,
they seemed giants indeed. Around each one
were a number of cypress knees, peculiar, stake-like
growths which come up to the surface of the
water to get air for the roots. Some stuck up
high out of the water, others did not quite reach
the surface. These last had a disconcerting way
of poking into the bottom of the boat or interfering
with the paddle. Several times they almost
capsized the cranky little bateau. “Ought
to have a pilot for these reefs,” Scott growled,
as he threaded his way slowly through them.</p>

<p class='c004'>He decided to skirt the east shore first and see
how large the thing really was. It might take
days, even weeks to see it all, but he felt sure that
the solution of the mystery was here in this
swamp and he did not know any other way to get
at it. The swamp seemed even more silent than
the river. Scott found it even more fascinating.
Occasionally enormous turtles poked heads almost
as large as saucers, and about as flat, above
the surface and eyed him curiously. He saw
several black, hairy spiders with a three-inch
spread of legs crawling on the tree trunks, and
twice he saw fat, cotton-mouthed moccasins uncoil
themselves sluggishly from the trunks of
fallen trees and glide silently into the water.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mile after mile he wound his way slowly among
the trees and the cypress knees, always keeping
in touch with the ragged shore line, and watching
keenly for any sign of a trail or landing
place. He found many of them but they all turned
out to be animal trails which showed no trace of
a human footstep. They were, nevertheless, intensely
interesting to Scott. He had always
prided himself on his woodcraft, and these medleys
of coon, fox, wildcat and deer tracks were
offering him new fields to conquer. He became
so interested in them that he traveled on and on
from one trail to another, wholly forgetful of
time. He found dozens of smaller tracks in the
black, plastic mud, tracks which he did not know,
and it piqued both his pride and his curiosity.
He almost forgot his object in coming there.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had pottered along this way for several
miles, following the crooked shore line of the
swamp and stopping to examine every trail when
a sudden pang of hunger caused him to glance at
his watch. It was three o’clock. He laid his paddle
across the bateau in front of him and sat there
idly watching the shore while he ate his lunch.
He had not thought to bring any water and the
black waters of the swamp looked uninviting.
However, he was well accustomed to eating dry
lunches in the Southwest and made out very well.
He decided that he would continue his search till
four o’clock and then start for home; but he became
so interested that he overstayed his time a
little. It was half-past four before he realized it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott knew that he could never reach the landing,
probably not even find the passage out of
the swamp, before dark, if he retraced his course
around the jagged shore line. It would be much
shorter and quicker to go directly across the
swamp to the hardwood bottom and then follow
that down to the opening. Unfortunately, the
sun disappeared behind a bunch of leaden clouds
before he had gone very far and left him without
a guide. The sameness of the swamp and the
utter lack of landmarks made it hard to hold
the course, but he felt pretty sure of his directions
and paddled on confidently as fast as the
cypress knees and partially submerged roots
would let him. Fallen trees and clumps of brush
forced him to make many short detours which
were very confusing. He had come much farther
that morning than he had realized.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had not seen any trace of the hardwoods
along the river when darkness came with the
swiftness so characteristic of the southern nightfall.
Darkness seemed literally to fall on him.
There was not a star in the sky and it was impossible
to penetrate the black veil for even a few
feet. He almost bumped into the trees before
he could make them out, and the cypress knees
which he could not see at all seemed to be everywhere.
And yet he groped his way along in the
hope of reaching the river.</p>

<p class='c004'>About nine o’clock the skies cleared. The light
helped him to make a little faster progress, but
he could not see any stars that he knew, and could
not make sure of his direction. He had almost
come to the conclusion that there was no limit to
this swamp, when a bank of black shadow loomed
ahead of him. It was a shore line of some kind.
Through the screen of brush he caught the shape
of a pine tree outlined against the sky. It was
not the hardwood strip along the river.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no use in going any farther now.
He was about as completely lost as he could very
well be. The moon would be up about eleven and
he might as well wait for it right there. He sat
motionless in the boat and listened to the small
noises of the night, an occasional splashing along
the edge of the swamp, the cry of a night heron,
or the rustling of restless, small birds in the
branches overhead. A gentle breeze was blowing
from the direction of the forest.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once a faint crackling in the brush, the faintest
snapping of a tiny twig sounded loud there
on the water, told him something was coming toward
him. His eyes had become pretty well
accustomed to the uncertain light, and as he
watched he recognized the form of a large raccoon
making his way out on to a log which
extended quite a way into the water. It was not
over twenty feet from the boat. Wholly unconscious
of the silent observer the coon deliberately
began to prepare his evening meal which he had
evidently brought with him. He tore it into
pieces, just what it was Scott could not see, and
carefully dipped a piece in the water. Then he
solemnly proceeded to wash it. He rubbed it
between his front paws and scrubbed it as thoroughly
as any laundress, and in much the same
way. When he was finally satisfied of its cleanliness
he repeated the process with another piece.
His meal ended, he washed his hands and waddled
ashore. Scott had often heard that the coon
would eat nothing without first dipping it in
water, but he had never imagined any such
thorough scouring as this. He no longer regretted
getting lost. Such a chance as that repaid
him several times over.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was almost sure once that he heard the
creaking of a chain, but it was very faint and was
not repeated. Shortly the moon came up almost
directly in front of him. He was headed straight
away from the river. With the shadows to guide
him he turned to the west once more. A couple
of hours’ paddling brought him to the hardwood
bottom land and he soon found a passage through
to the river. It was not the same passage where
he had come in, but one considerably farther up
the river.</p>

<p class='c004'>From there on he had no trouble in finding his
way. The tide was running out and the bateau
traveled freely. He had marked the landing well
and soon had the boat hidden in the accustomed
place. When he sneaked quietly into the cabin
it was half-past three, but he stopped to have a
look at the pantry before he turned in.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Graham raised his head and had a squint
at him, but he did not ask any questions, he did
not have to—he knew what had happened to a
man in a strange swamp on a cloudy day.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The next morning Scott went back up the
river to continue the exploration of the
swamp. He had some provisions along
this time and was determined to stay out until
he had finished the job. He would lose too much
time going back to the cabin every night. He
also had a compass. He decided to paddle on
past the first channel into the swamp to the one
where he had come out the night before, or rather
early that same morning. It had appeared to
him the night before to be about a half a mile
farther up the stream. He had certainly covered
much more than that distance now, but had
not discovered any sign of it. Perhaps it had
seemed shorter traveling downstream. He would
go on a little farther. For another half mile he
poked along the shore examining every break in
the brush which might indicate a passage, but
none of them proved to be any more than a little
bay in the shore.</p>

<p class='c004'>He knew now that he must have passed it. He
considered paddling on up to the channel which
the loggers used and starting his search from
there, but he thought it might be better to keep
his search a secret till he had completed it, and
turned back to hunt once more for the hidden
channel.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Seems funny,” Scott muttered to himself,
“that I could stumble through that passage in
the night and can’t find it now in broad daylight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He paddled briskly back to the place where he
had started his careful search. From there on
he examined every foot of the shore. He had
not gone very far when he stumbled on to a
clump of tall brush which overhung the water.
Ordinarily he would have passed it without a
thought, but he was looking for something now,
and he pushed the bushes aside with his paddle
to make sure. There, sure enough, he looked
into a perfectly clear and open channel through
the bank into the swamp. It was broad on the
inside like the top of a funnel and it was quite
easy to see why it had not impressed him as a
hidden channel on his outward trip. He wondered
whether its existence was known to the
loggers. He examined the shores and the approach,
but could not find any trace. Of course
that was no proof that boats had not used it, but
it was hardly possible that any great number of
logs had ever been worked through it without
leaving some evidence.</p>

<p class='c004'>He struck out boldly across the swamp, traveling
due east, and soon came to the forest shore.
A brief examination told him that he had passed
there the day before and he paddled rapidly
northward till he recognized the beginning of
new territory. From there on he took up a minute
examination of the shore line. After his experience
with the passage into the river he was even
more careful than he had been the day before.
All day long he poked slowly in and out of the
little bays, scrutinizing every trail and not forgetting
an occasional glance out into the swamp.
Not a single sign did he see to indicate that any
one had ever been in the place before.</p>

<p class='c004'>Night fell on him unexpectedly as on the night
before and he determined to land and camp in
the pine forest. He landed on a big log which
extended out into the water and made the bateau
fast. The night was so clear and warm that he
decided not to put up a tent. His sleeping bag
would give him all the protection that he needed.
As he was still bent on keeping his whereabouts
secret and did not know how near to the camp
he might be, he determined to go without a fire
and content himself with a cold supper. Ordinarily
he would have picked a location next to a
log or tree, but when he thought of the enormous
spiders he had seen and the venomous scorpions
of which he had heard, he selected an open spot
in a little clearing. He could not put the rattlesnakes
and cottonmouths entirely out of his
mind, but he tried hard to forget them.</p>

<p class='c004'>His simple supper was soon eaten and he sat in
the starlight once more, listening to the small
noises of the night. To the uninitiated these
small noises often pass unnoticed and seem only
to intensify the stillness. With many of them
Scott was already familiar, but in this strange
country there were others with which he was
wholly unfamiliar. While he was trying to identify
some of these he heard once more the creaking
of a chain. It had been so faint the night
before, and turtles and frogs are capable of such
strange, creaking noises, that he had not been
sure of it, but it was nearer to-night and he caught
a distinct metallic ring in it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott was all excitement now. He listened so
intently that it almost hurt, but the sound did not
come again. Once he thought that he heard the
drip of a paddle but he could not be sure of that.
It was possible that he was in sound of the camp.
Sound travels far over the water on a still night.
He had no idea where the camp was. But if he
were close enough to the camp to hear the creaking
of a chain he would certainly hear other
noises unless the camp was very different from
any other he had ever seen. It was a great temptation
to scout around the edge of the swamp on
foot in an attempt to locate the camp, but that
would be foolish and possibly dangerous when
he was so unfamiliar with the country. The pine
had not been cut here as yet. That was a pretty
good indication that he was not anywhere near
the camp.</p>

<p class='c004'>He sat long into the night, long after the moon
had risen, listening, but in all that time not another
suspicious sound came out of the weird
tangle of the swamp. It was past midnight when
he relaxed his straining nerves and crawled into
his sleeping bag with a shiver, for he had not
noticed the damp night chill which had crept into
his very bones while he was sitting there motionless.
Several times he caught himself listening
again, wild-eyed, and even after he finally went
to sleep he continued to dream of that creaking
chain so vividly that in the morning he could not
tell whether he had really heard it again or not.</p>

<p class='c004'>So eager was he to investigate that curious
sound that he could hardly wait to eat breakfast.
All his stuff was soon loaded in the old bateau
and he set off excitedly on his search. The question
was, should he continue to follow the shore
line as he had been doing or should he take the
direction from which the sound had seemed to
come? He decided to follow the shore line. It
would be better to complete the shore line and
then examine the open swamp. Scott always liked
to know what was behind him. He soon found
that he had not slept very close to the camp. The
shore line was bare of trails here and he traveled
at a lively pace. Yet, at the end of an hour, he
had not seen anything of the pond or the logging
camp.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This blamed old swamp must connect with
the Lake of the Woods,” Scott growled as he
paddled on. “It does not seem as though we
could have ridden this far the other day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When he rounded a point a half mile farther
on, where an arm of the swamp ran off to the
eastward, he suddenly saw the camp and the log
pond before him. He sat motionless in the bateau
and looked the place over in detail. It was much
as it had been when he saw it before except that
there were more logs in the pond. Only one man
was in sight. He was working up at the other
end of the pond building a section of a raft.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott watched this man thoughtfully for some
time. He bored a hole through the end of a four-inch
pole with a large augur and also bored another
hole near the end of one of the logs. Then
he drove a wooden peg through the hole in the
pole and into the hole in the log. He repeated
this operation at the other end of the pole with
another log. Then he fastened the other ends of
these two logs together in the same way. That
made the framework for his raft. With a long
pike pole he herded some other logs over to this
frame. By pressing down on the pole he made
the logs one by one duck under the crosspole and
take their places between the two outer logs.
When the space was filled this section of the raft
was completed. He then proceeded to build another
just like it. A number of these sections
would be chained together end to end and the
long, snakelike raft would be ready for its trip
down the river.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where in thunder did <i>you</i> spend the night?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The voice was so close to him and so unexpected
that Scott almost upset the cranky little
bateau. Then he recognized a face staring at him
out of a clump of bushes close beside the boat
and realized that he was near the stump where he
had seen Murphy perched on their former trip.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hello,” Scott answered somewhat uncertainly
when he had sufficiently recovered from his surprise.
He was chagrined to think that he had
not seen Murphy before. “Been there ever since
we left?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The man at the other end of the pond was too
far off to hear their voices, but Murphy was
afraid their conversation might reveal his hiding
place. “Back up out of sight,” he said, “and I’ll
join you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott retreated out of sight of the pond and
Murphy soon joined him in a tiny bateau.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” Murphy said in answer to Scott’s question,
“I have not been there ever since you left,
but I spent the night there. Where were you last
night?” he repeated. He seemed to be excited.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How do you know that I was not at home?”
Scott asked suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’d be some paddler if you got up here this
time of morning,” Murphy laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott had not thought of that. “I camped
down there in the woods a couple of miles, near
the edge of the swamp.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did you hear the creaking of a chain about
nine o’clock?” Murphy asked with suppressed excitement.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought I did,” Scott replied cautiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So did I,” Murphy exclaimed emphatically.
“It was rather faint but it could not have been
anything else. There was something doing out
there in that swamp somewhere. I took a sneak
out that way, but could not find anything.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no doubting Murphy’s sincerity.
He was fairly quivering with excitement. His
knowledge of the country and his familiarity with
the ways of the loggers would be of great help
and Scott threw his suspicions to the winds.
Moreover, he wanted somebody with whom he
could talk. “I heard it the night before, too,” he
confided.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did you?” Murphy exclaimed eagerly. “I
was not here that night. What are you going to
do now?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott explained what he had already done and
suggested that Murphy join him in completing
the examination of the rest of the shore line.
Murphy was more than willing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They seem to be getting a raft ready to send
out now,” Scott said. “Do you know when they
will start with it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Usually start about the time the tide turns
out. That will mean about five o’clock this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you any grub?” Scott asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, but I can get some pretty quick. Ought
to go to the cabin before I go off anywhere anyway.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right. I’ll go up with you. Then we’ll
make the rounds of the river bank and wait down
there to see that raft go by.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They landed well out of sight of the logging
camp and struck off through the woods for Murphy’s
ranger cabin.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Murphy had a very attractive little
cabin back there in the woods and a
little wife who looked perfectly capable
of running things while he was away, and
while he was home, too, if necessary. She did
not seem in the least alarmed at the prospect of
being alone for possibly two or three days. Murphy
tossed the necessary supplies into his pack
sack and they were soon on their way back to the
bateau. They loaded all the duffle into Scott’s
boat and Murphy took the bow paddle.</p>

<p class='c004'>It seemed that the log pond was a natural,
bottle-shaped arm of the big swamp. From the
mouth of it to the river a quarter of a mile away
a channel had been cleared of all brush and cypress
knees which might interfere with the passage
of the log rafts, but there were no booms
or anything else to separate it from the rest of
the swamp.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They pole the rafts out that channel to the
river,” Murphy explained, “and let them drift
with the tide and the current the rest of the way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should think they would be hung up on the
banks all the time,” Scott objected.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, they don’t turn them loose. There are
always two men on them. There is a long sweep
on each end of the raft, and by means of those
they can usually keep in the channel and make
the bends all right. Of course they have to tie
up when the tide comes in and wait till she turns
again. It is an ideal lazy man’s job, and these
niggers love it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The north shore of the swamp swung considerably
farther to the north and they were at least
two miles above the channel when they came out
on the river. In all that distance they had seen
nothing but animal trails similar to the ones which
Scott had found lower down. Murphy was able
to explain many of the tracks which had puzzled
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The hardwood strip was wider here and they
landed to explore it. It was a quarter of a mile
across to the river, but a coon trail was the only
sign of life which they discovered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” Scott said, “it may not help us any
but we have the satisfaction of knowing that
nothing goes into or comes out of that swamp except
at the logging camp or by way of the river.”
He had not been looking for anything in particular
and did not know exactly whether he felt disappointed
or relieved at not finding it. They
knew now where they did <i>not</i> have to look for
the thieves and that would help.</p>

<p class='c004'>They returned to the boat and continued to
examine the shore down to the log channel. The
strip of dry land was only about four rods wide
at this point. The channel was not a natural
opening like the two which Scott had found below.
It had been dug out and showed very clearly
the signs of much use. The banks had been
gouged out by the passing rafts, and tramped by
many feet. They searched the ground for some
distance on either side but could not find anything
to show that the men who had made the
tracks had ever done more than step ashore to
help shove the rafts through the channel.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was getting rather late in the afternoon but
they thought they would have time to paddle
downstream to see how many openings there were
into the river and get back in time to see the
raft come out. As the tide was coming in they
stayed in the swamp. It is very often some little
thing like this which changes the whole course of
events. If they had only gone down the river.
But they did not.</p>

<p class='c004'>They did not examine the shore here with the
same care. It did not occur to them that there
could be anything there of particular interest.
About a mile brought them to the first one. It
was much broader and deeper than the one Scott
had found in the morning, but was so overhung
with trees and brush that it would not be readily
noticed from the river. A rather hurried examination
did not reveal any traces of use. They
did not know how much farther down they would
have to go and were anxious to get back before
the raft went out. Another mile brought them
to another opening.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That settles that part of it!” Scott exclaimed.
“This is where I went in this morning. There is
only one more opening below this, and that is
down at the lower end of the swamp. I have
been all the way around her now. There are just
these four channels into the river.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And two of them,” Murphy said, “are new
ones on me. I have been down that river dozens
of times. Funny I never noticed them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They are pretty well screened from the river,”
Scott replied. “Don’t look as though either of
them had ever been used.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Without further search they paddled back for
the log channel so that they would not be in the
way of the raftsmen, and had just time enough to
pick a good hiding place before it was dark. The
sky was clear and from where they sat they could
see the river and the mouth of the log canal
plainly. A fire was out of the question and they
ate their cold supper in silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott was getting used to this night gloom in
the big swamp now. It did not seem as weird as
it had before, possibly because he was not alone,
but there was a certain fascination about it which
kept his interest on edge. The monotonous
splashing of the drooping branches dipping in the
current seemed to take on a certain musical
rhythm. The booming of the bull bats as they
dropped down into the opening over the river and
the honking of the lonely night heron fitted in
like the solo parts in an orchestra. Suddenly
there was a shriek which made Scott’s blood run
cold. It certainly could not have been written
in the music.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What in thunder was that?” he whispered excitedly,
and then joined in the silent laugh with
Murphy. Even before he had finished speaking
he had recognized the hunting cry of the great
barred owl. There is no more blood-curdling
sound, and coming as it did on tensely listening
nerves it had raised the hair on both their heads.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is enough to make every mouse and
small bird in the woods die of heart failure,” Scott
whispered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Probably what he does it for,” Murphy whispered
back. “A little more and he’d got me, too.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was not till about eleven o’clock that they
heard the sound of voices floating faintly toward
them from the direction of the pond. After a
long silence they heard them again much nearer,
and soon the splash of the poles trailing through
the water was distinctly audible. The blow of a
hammer and the clank of a chain caused Scott to
look at Murphy inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They have to break up the raft to get it out
into the current,” Murphy whispered.</p>

<p class='c004'>After considerable delay and splashing three
sections of the raft shot out of the canal and
swung downstream as they were caught by the
current. They were tied to a tree by a rope and
swung back against the near shore. After another
delay and more splashing another three
sections appeared and settled neatly in behind the
others. Two men came quickly out of the shadow
on to the raft and chained the two parts securely
together. They disappeared to untie the mooring
ropes, appeared again quickly to man the sweeps
and slowly worked the raft out into midstream as
it glided down the silent current. It seemed like
a ghost raft on the river Styx.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two men in the brush watched intently as
the raft glided by. No sooner were they out of
hearing than Murphy turned excitedly. “Those
were white men on that raft,” he whispered.
“The light was too uncertain to make them out,
but they were white men and one of them looked
like Qualley.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The fellow in the bow looked to me something
like that superintendent at the turpentine camp,”
Scott said doubtfully, “but I may have been mistaken.
I have never seen him but once.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sir, that’s exactly who it was. Now
what do you suppose he is doing over here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Before Scott could answer they both heard
quite distinctly that clanking of a chain which
had come to them the night before from somewhere
out there in the swamp. It was much
plainer than it had been before and seemed
nearer. They listened intently for a few minutes
but heard nothing more.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let’s take a sneak out that way,” Murphy suggested
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott nodded and they scrambled silently across
the neck of land to the boat in the swamp. “Don’t
make any noise,” Scott cautioned. “We do not
want them to know that we are on the lookout
any sooner than we can help.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The moon had not yet come up and it was so
dark back there in the swamp that they made slow
progress. Every few minutes they stopped to listen.
Once or twice they thought they heard a
faint splashing, but sounds are very hard to locate
in such a place. After more than an hour
of fruitless search they gave it up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, what?” Murphy whispered as they sat
disconsolate in the middle of the swamp.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How far is it down to the place where they sell
those logs?” Scott asked thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“About fifteen miles.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will they make it with that raft to-night?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, they tie up during the flood tide, you
know, and they had already lost a couple of hours
of the ebb when they started. They will not get
more than half way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let’s follow them,” Scott suggested. “I don’t
suppose we shall see anything, but I would like
to talk to those people at the mill.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy agreed and they were soon threading
their way through the cypress knees back to the
log canal. They reached there just too late to see
another bateau disappear up the channel toward
the camp. They glided out into the river and
paddled silently with the current. As they did
not know where they might run on to the raft
they approached all the bends cautiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The tide will be turning pretty quick now,”
Murphy whispered. “When it does they will tie
up, and when they tie up they will go to sleep.
That will give us a chance to get around them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Some distance farther down they were sneaking
cautiously around a bend when Murphy held
up his hand in warning and Scott brought the
bateau to a stop. Not fifty yards away they could
see the shadowy outline of the raft lying close in
under the shadow of the trees. There was a small
fire burning at the far end of it and they could
see two forms flitting about in the flickering light.
They had evidently just arrived and were busy
making the raft fast to the shore.</p>

<p class='c004'>The amateur detectives pushed their bateau
well in under the shadow of the brush-covered
bank and settled down to watch. They did not
have long to wait. The men soon completed their
preparations and settled down beside the fire.
The low sound of voices soon gave place to silence
which was in time broken by a long whistling
snore.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is accommodating of that fellow,” Scott
whispered. “If it were not for his music we
might have sat here for an hour trying to find
out whether he was asleep. Shall we make a
sneak for it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Better wait a few minutes,” Murphy suggested,
“till we can make sure of the other fellow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The other man was either awake or he did not
snore. They listened in vain for ten minutes and
decided to take a chance on it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Think we better try to steal by under the
shadow of the opposite shore?” Scott asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not for mine,” Murphy answered, “the fellow
might be awake and mistake us for a deer. I’d
rather take a chance on floating right down the
middle of the stream.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott thought the suggestion a good one. He
had seen one of those men shoot and he did not
feel like playing deer for him. The moon was
just coming up and would make them uncomfortably
conspicuous, but there was nothing else
to do unless they wanted to wait there all night.
A single shove sent the bateau out from the shore
and it floated very slowly down the stream. The
tide was just on the turn and it seemed that they
would never get by that raft. At last they were
out of sight around a bend in the river. They
paddled silently for a few minutes. Then Scott’s
excitement broke all bounds.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did you notice anything peculiar about that
raft?” he whispered eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy shook his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There were <i>eight</i> sections in it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” Murphy exclaimed incredulously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sir, I thought it was a mile long from the
length of time it took us to get by and I counted
the sections. There were eight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where in thunder did they pick up the other
two?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Neither of them had any answer for that and
they paddled on, thoughtfully silent. It was possible
that the raft had broken the night before
and they were picking up the pieces. There was
not much chance now of finding out where they
got it. The next best thing would be to see how
they got rid of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the matter with our getting some
sleep?” Murphy asked. “We can go ashore till
the tide turns. They can’t start before that and
we can easily beat it out ahead of them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There did not seem to be any good reason why
they should not and they turned in to the first
high land they saw. They built a fire and made
the coffee they could not have at supper. The
night had turned cold enough for them to get
pretty well chilled while they were watching the
raftsmen go to sleep. The fire and the coffee
soon warmed them up. They hauled their blankets
out of the boat and were soon asleep beside
the little fire.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Murphy had figured that the tide
would turn again at about six o’clock
in the morning. By five he was up
getting breakfast. Scott soon joined him. There
was a cold fog hanging over the river and they
crowded close around the fire. The temperature
was not conducive to conversation. It was not
till the heat of the fire had thawed them out a
little that Murphy broke the silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you dead sure that there were eight sections
in that raft?” he asked. It was the second
time that Scott’s observation had proved better
than his own and it piqued him a little. The
power of observation is one of the woodman’s
most valuable faculties.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I sure am,” Scott replied, “I counted them
twice.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you suppose those fellows are selling those
logs to the mill on a separate account?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is what I want to find out if I can. I
thought it would be interesting to see how they
handle the thing when they come in with the
raft.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy chuckled. “It will be good sport to
stand there and see them sell those logs which
they have been to so much trouble to steal for
the credit of the company.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They were in high spirits and sent the bateau
skimming down the river at a tremendous rate.
It was not yet nine o’clock when they landed at
the mill dock. They knew that the raft could not
get in before ten or eleven. It was the first southern
mill Scott had ever seen, with its great open
pile of ever-burning sawdust and slabs blazing
away as though to invite the destruction of the
mill by fire. The upper part of the mill was
built like a summer house, with open sides. Instead
of the little short logs he had seen in the
north the big band saw was ripping up logs forty
and even sixty feet long.</p>

<p class='c004'>The manager saw them and came over for a
chat. He knew Murphy and greeted Scott cordially.
“Still looking for the timber thieves?”
he asked pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Still at it,” Murphy admitted.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose you get a great many logs in here
from all up and down the river?” Scott asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” the manager answered, “not now. We
used to buy in small lots from many owners, but
that was before Qualley started up there. We
had quite a supply on hand when he started and
he is getting the stuff down to us now just about
fast enough to keep us going. We only cut about
forty thousand feet a day. I am not sure, but I
do not believe that we have bought a log from
any one else for almost a year.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are there any other mills on the river?” Scott
asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, this is the only one down this way. There
may be some more up the river, but if there are
they are a long way up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Just then a big doubledeck river steamer with
her tall smokestacks and queer-looking stern paddle
wheel went by spanking her way up against
the current.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t suppose one of those things would tow
a raft up the river?” Scott suggested.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Too slow for them. They are slow enough
any way and a raft tow would cost her more than
the logs are worth.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t see what good it would do any one
to steal logs here, then,” Scott said. “What could
they do with them when they get them?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s what Murphy has been trying to find
out for a couple of years,” the manager laughed.
“He thought for a while that I was buying stolen
property here, but he has never been able to prove
it on me. Like to look over the mill, Mr. Burton?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott was glad of the opportunity to keep in
touch with the manager till the rafts came in,
and eagerly accepted the invitation. They followed
the manager through the strange mill
which looked so much like a summer house to
Scott with its open sides and elevated tramways
leading out to the lumber yard. He watched the
long logs come dripping up the jack chain on to
the log deck, saw the powerful steam nigger toss
the great trunks on to the long saw carriage as
though they had been so many toothpicks and
listened to the shriek of the big band saw as it
tore through the screaming log. The explosive
exhaust of the shotgun feed as the newly sawed
plank fell away from the cant had always sounded
to Scott like a shout of triumph. In five minutes
that shining ribbon of steel had slashed up the
growth of three or four centuries. Perhaps La
Salle had marched beneath the branches of that
very tree.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was fascinating to watch the perfect working
of those powerful machines, and Scott never
tired of it, but he was watching to-day with only
one eye, the other was on the bend of the river
above the mill. They followed the lumber clear
through the sorting shed and even out to the piles
in the lumber yard; they examined the dry kiln
and watched the noisy flooring machines in the
planing mill, and even then the raft had not arrived.
Scott glanced questioningly at Murphy.
What could be delaying them so long?</p>

<p class='c004'>It was almost noon before the nose of the tardy
raft poked around the distant bend in the river.
They were sitting in the office talking as usual of
the mystery of the stolen logs. Scott was so glad
to see the rafts that he felt like shouting, but he
wanted to see what the manager would do. Possibly
it would be a little embarrassing for him to
have visitors from the National Forest at his elbow
when the raft came in. But if Scott expected
any such thing he was disappointed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here come some of your runaways now,” the
manager remarked with a smile when he caught
sight of the raft. “Let’s go down and see what
they’ve got.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The raft was still quite a distance up the river
and well out in the middle of the stream, but they
could see the men working steadily at the great
sweeps edging the clumsy craft over toward the
opening in the upper end of the log boom. They
made their way out along the double boom to have
a look at the logs and to get within speaking distance
of the men.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By George,” Murphy whispered excitedly to
Scott, “those are niggers on that raft now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott paused to get a better look at the men and
uttered a suppressed exclamation. He grasped
Murphy’s arm. “Look there,” he whispered,
“there are only six sections.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought you were dreaming last night,”
Murphy retorted. “Been hanging around the
swamp too much at night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not on your life,” Scott exclaimed decisively.
“I’d bet my last cent that there were eight sections
in that raft last night when we passed it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy smiled incredulously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sort of late to-day,” the manager called to
the darkies on the raft.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yas, suh,” one of the darkies answered with
the usual grin, “we wuz kinda late ketchin’ de
tide dis mahnin’.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How much did you bring me this time,
George?” the manager asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah don’t know, suh, but I’se got some writin’
heah fo’ you from Mistah Qualley.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The raft had floated down against the boom
and the darky addressed as “George” handed
over a scale bill. The manager glanced at it and
offered it to Scott. “Want to check them up?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott looked at it rather doubtfully. The log
sizes in that country were all so different from
what he was used to that he knew that he could
not even estimate the contents of the logs very
accurately. He thought that the best thing to do
was to admit it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know more about this than I do,” he said,
passing the paper on to Murphy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy glanced at the totals and walked
slowly over the raft examining the ends of the
logs. “Nobody would get rich on the difference
any way,” he remarked when he had finished.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where did you tie up for the night?” Scott
asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>George seemed to hesitate for a moment.
Scott thought that he started to say something
and then changed his mind. “About seben miles
up de ribber,” he finally answered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you always tie up at the same place?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can’t always make it, Cap’n,” the darky
grinned. “De tide, she say whar to tie up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have much trouble getting your raft out
through the swamp last night?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The darky rolled his eyes a little suspiciously.
“No, boss, she come through mighty slick.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott saw now that the darky was lying fluently
and knew that there was no chance to get any
more truth out of him, if, indeed, they had gotten
any at all.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, Mr. Brown,” he said, speaking loud
enough for the darkies to hear, “I guess the scale
is all right. We thought maybe they were slipping
some extras into the rafts, but we seem to
have been mistaken. I hope you will pardon me
for suspecting you, but it is my business right
now to suspect every one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Suspect all you please,” Mr. Brown laughed,
“but let’s go down to dinner. I wish I were getting
those logs. They do not bring me any too
many and I have very few on reserve in the
pond.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They accepted Mr. Brown’s invitation to dinner
but started up river immediately afterwards.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now we’ll see what became of those two extra
sections,” Scott said with determination as they
lost sight of the mill.</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy did not answer. He had not seen those
extra sections himself and he was not altogether
convinced that Scott had seen them either. Scott
knew how Murphy felt about it and that made
him all the more determined to find them and
prove that he was right.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a long time they paddled in silence. They
kept a sharp lookout on both sides and investigated
everything which looked like a possible
opening in the low-lying banks. They had not
found anything when they turned the bend into
the stretch of the river where the raft had been
tied up for the night.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was nothing there. “Must have sunk,”
Murphy chuckled.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott did not deign to answer. He was a good
deal more puzzled than Murphy because he was
sure that he had seen them the night before. He
directed the bateau over to the place where the
raft had been tied. There was plenty of evidence
there to show that the rafts had been tied there
many times before, but there were certainly no
sections there now. Two sections of raft, each
forty feet long, are not easily hidden.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wonder if that steamer could have picked
them up?” he asked gloomily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not likely to,” Murphy grinned. “Those logs
will weigh from six to eight tons apiece.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott was absorbed in his own puzzled thoughts
and had lost interest for the time being in his
surroundings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hello, there!” Murphy exclaimed excitedly as
they passed the place where the rear of the raft
had been tied.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott was instantly alert. Behind the tangle of
brush and vines which hung clear down to the
surface of the water he could see what looked
like an opening in the swampy shore line. He
immediately turned the bateau toward it and they
forced their way under the heavy screen of vegetation.</p>

<p class='c004'>They both uttered an exclamation of surprise.
They were in what appeared to be the mouth of
a bayou about thirty feet wide. The sides of it
were swampy and a bend about a hundred feet
ahead shut in the view. They paddled silently
up the creek with the feeling of a couple of bloodhounds
on a hot scent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Holy St. Christopher!” Murphy exclaimed excitedly
as the bow of the bateau poked around
the bend.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott could hardly wait to see the cause of the
excitement, but even when he did see it he did
not grasp the full significance of it at once. Instead
of the sleepy, vine-covered bayou which
they had so nearly passed by unnoticed—a place
so wild that Scott’s imagination had once more
jumped back to the old explorers pushing their
way into unknown channels which no white man
had ever seen before—the bayou stretched out
before them like a modern canal. All the bordering
brush and overhanging vines had been cleared
away. A deep-worn tow path followed close
along the northern bank. The shores were deeply
gouged and torn as if by the passage of many
rafts of logs. Moreover, many of the signs were
very fresh.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott gazed at it in wide-eyed amazement.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe you were right about that raft having
eight sections,” Murphy mumbled. “Looks as
though it might have had eight hundred of them.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>For a few minutes the men sat in wondering
silence. The very boldness of the
scheme was astounding. Here was a
canal carefully and thoroughly prepared for the
sole purpose of transporting stolen logs and not
more than a hundred feet from the river where
steamboats plied up and down and the rightful
owner of the logs passed frequently.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Some nerve!” Murphy finally exclaimed, expressing
the thought which was uppermost in
both their minds.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we’ve found where they go,” Scott remarked
with a sigh of satisfaction, “but what do
you suppose they do with them? Is there any
railroad over that way or any other stream to the
coast?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy shook his head. “Not a trace of one
unless they have a secret one like this canal.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose there is no telling how far this
goes,” Scott mused, “but I have a hunch that we
better tackle it a little carefully. Any man with
the nerve to steal logs the way this fellow is stealing
them probably would not hesitate at anything.
I doubt if he would welcome a visit from a couple
of forest service uniforms.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy felt for his holster and seemed comforted
at finding it where it belonged. His Irish
was rising fast at the prospect of a possible fight.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Suppose we paddle slowly up the bayou,”
Scott suggested, “and keep our eyes open. They
have been undisturbed so long that I doubt if
they keep any kind of guard and we ought to be
able to see them before they see us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>That plan suited Murphy perfectly. He laid
his automatic on the bow of the bateau where it
would be handy and paddled ahead. They went
very slowly, sneaking cautiously up to every bend
and stopping frequently to listen. They had covered
at least a mile in this way without seeing any
signs which looked suspicious or anything to indicate
that they were getting any closer to their
destination. Not a sound broke the afternoon
stillness of the forest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Must be selling those logs in Mobile,” Murphy
grumbled.</p>

<p class='c004'>As they poked the bow of the bateau slowly
around the next bend there was a tremendous
splashing in the water ahead. Murphy snatched
up his pistol and Scott whisked the bateau back
under the protection of the bank with all his
strength. They both looked rather foolish when
a bunch of ducks rose noisily honking and finally
made it out over the treetops some distance ahead
of them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They were pretty nearly as badly scared as
we were, anyway,” Murphy growled as he resumed
his paddle.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott estimated that they had come at least
four miles from the river and still there was no
sign of logs or life. “Think we’ll have provisions
enough to last us on this trip?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>The canal had cleared the river swamp now
and lay in a narrow strip of baygall between
ridges of pine forest which had been neither
logged nor turpentined. They still talked with
hushed voices though they were apparently miles
from anywhere.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wonder if this neck connects with the big
swamp over west?” Murphy said. “I have heard
about that swamp but have never been there.
They say it is a whale of a big one and runs down
within a very few miles of the coast.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shouldn’t wonder,” Scott growled as they
paddled slowly along. “Seems as though it might
connect with the Pacific Coast. Pity Columbus
didn’t find it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was getting late in the afternoon when they
paused at a bend in the bayou to listen for the
hundredth time. They straightened up suddenly
and looked inquiringly at each other. The faint
but unmistakable whine of a sawmill sounded
plaintively from somewhere far ahead of them.
The light of triumph was in their eyes now, but
they were too excited to talk. Without a word
they both bent to their work and paddled eagerly
forward. The country on either side was more
open now, and there was less chance of their
running into any one unexpectedly. Every time
they stopped to listen the whine of the saw was
more distinct. It seemed too good to be true and
they had to listen often to assure themselves that
they were not dreaming.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last they could see the smoke through the
trees and finally reached a point where they could
make out the hazy outlines of the camp. It was
the crudest kind of an outfit. A small portable
mill sat out in the open without the protection of
even so much as a shed-roof, and scattered about
it were three miserable cabins—mere board
shacks. Only one little pile of lumber was in
sight. They sat for a few minutes and gazed at
it in silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” Scott remarked, “there she is. The
next question is, how are we going to get close
enough to identify our lumber without getting
shot?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy’s Irish blood was boiling. He had
been looking for those timber thieves for two
years, and now that they were in sight he was
for stalking in on them and arresting them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rush ’em!” he exclaimed angrily. “Rush
right in on them. Take them by surprise and we
can arrest the whole outfit easy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It might be possible, all right,” Scott replied,
weighing the possibilities, “but it seems to me
doubtful. We have only one gun. There are
six of those fellows in sight and probably more
in the cabins. If they were all in one bunch we
might stand a show, but while we were covering
the ones there at the mill it would be a cinch for
any one in the cabin to pot us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy had to admit the truth of that, but he
was in favor of trying it anyway. “What are
you going to do then?” he asked peevishly when
Scott shook his head in disapproval of the scheme.
“Not going to run home and let them get away?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No reason why they should run away when
they do not know that we have found them. But
I was not thinking of running away. My plan
is to reconnoiter the place as closely as we can,
find out how many men there are here, identify
our logs, and possibly close in on them at night.
We haven’t any warrant for them, and probably
they are not the fellows who are stealing the
stuff. They are only hired men and if we arrest
them the real thieves who are engineering the
job at a safe distance may get wind of it and
get away. No, I think we better just hang around
here and keep out of sight till we can find out
who is running this outfit. Then we can nail him
and we’ll have something worth while.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hadn’t thought of that,” Murphy admitted,
cooling off a little. “It would be too bad to lose
the main guy after all. Best thing we can do is
to take to the brush here and wait till dark. Can’t
be over half an hour now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They tore their eyes from the mill and turned
to examine the near-by brush for a good hiding
place. “There is a good thick clump over there,”
Scott said, pointing to a clump a little way ahead
of them, “where we can hide the bateau and ourselves,
too. It’s——”</p>

<p class='c004'>The words died on his lips and his eyes almost
popped out of his head. In that very clump of
brush there were a pair of big eyes as round as
his own and fixed full upon him. Blue, frightened
eyes they were, and they no sooner found
that they were observed than they disappeared
like a flash. Scott shot the bateau forward to
have a close look and was just in time to see a very
small boy minus any clothes at all streaking it
through the brush toward the camp as though his
life depended on it—and he probably thought that
it did. He had evidently been swimming in the
bayou and had been cut off from his clothes by
their approach.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now we are in for it!” Scott exclaimed, as he
pointed out the flying figure to Murphy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where did he come from?” Murphy asked,
frowning.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Out of that clump of brush right there in
front of us. I just happened to see his eyes. It is
a good thing we were talking in whispers or the
little rascal would have overheard every word
that we said.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Probably heard every word of it anyway,”
Murphy growled. “Now they’ll be down here to
investigate. Shall we wait for them or go to
meet them?” The idea of retreating never so
much as entered Murphy’s head.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott had other plans. “Maybe if we can get
out of here without being seen or leaving any
trace behind us, hide the bateau in one of these
brush piles and hide ourselves they will not find
us and will think that the kid was lying. He was
not very large, you know, and they would not put
much faith in his story.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The plan did not appeal to Murphy. He was
getting mad again and wanted to fight. “What’ll
we gain by that? Why not stay here and scrap
it out?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because we are trying to find out a little something
about this thing without being seen
ourselves,” Scott retorted a little sharply. “Stir them
up now and the whole gang may get away before
we can do anything with them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll bet I could stop two or three of them,”
Murphy growled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll land on that clump of grass there on
the left where we will not leave any footprints
and get the bateau out of the water,” Scott said
firmly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy obeyed in silence. It was easy to see
that he did not approve, but he obeyed. Keeping
the clump of brush in which the boy had been
hiding between them and the camp, they landed
on a bunch of roots and lifted the bateau bodily
from the water. They made their way carefully
to a large brush pile back some fifty feet from
the edge of the bayou. There they carefully hid
the boat and concealed themselves. “It will be
dark in about ten minutes,” Scott whispered. “If
they don’t find us pretty quick they will not have
much chance of seeing us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dark don’t bother one of those infernal
hounds much,” Murphy grumbled. “They’ll find
us easy enough and pull us out of here like a
couple of rats.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A lump popped up into Scott’s throat so hard
that it almost choked him. The thought of the
keen-nosed hounds with which almost every
southern camp is infested had never occurred to
him, but he tried to put a bold face on it. “Well,
we’ll have to take a chance on that. We can fight
if we have to, but we won’t unless we do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He was conscious that Murphy was eyeing him
curiously with a trace of contempt and he knew
that he was being suspected of cowardice, but his
judgment told him that his was the wiser plan
and he stuck to it, hard as it was.</p>

<p class='c004'>They had not much more than covered up their
tracks and settled down to watch developments
when they saw a man riding leisurely from the
direction of the camp. He was trying to look
unconcerned, but he rode directly toward the
clump of bushes where the boy had been hiding.
They were both rejoiced to see that the almost
inevitable hound was lacking so far, and they
were not a little relieved that the rider was on
the other side of the canal. He wore the usual
overalls, cotton shirt and old felt hat, and was a
total stranger to both of them. An old thirty-thirty
Winchester was balanced carelessly across
the horn of his saddle.</p>

<p class='c004'>He drew rein on the opposite side of the canal,
glanced at the clothes which the boy had left, and
ran his eye carefully along the banks in both directions
as far as he could see. Evidently it had
not occurred to him that the bateau might have
been taken out of the water, for his examination
was too rapid to take account of anything as inconspicuous
as footprints. Without any apparent
suspicion he turned toward the river and rode
rapidly away down the tow path and out of sight.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If he keeps that gait up long it will be dark
before he gets back,” Scott chuckled.</p>

<p class='c004'>Evidently the boy had been keeping pretty close
watch on the man. The horseman had hardly
disappeared from view when the boy came running
toward the canal. He moved more cautiously
as he approached the clump of bushes and
stopped to examine them minutely. Satisfied that
there was nothing there he pounced on his clothes
and proceeded to change them for the old pair of
his father’s overalls which he had on. His curiosity
was not so easily satisfied as the man’s. He
examined the shore foot by foot to see if the boat
had landed, scanned the surrounding country suspiciously
every now and then, and once glanced
curiously across at the brush pile which concealed
the spies. Finally he, too, trailed away down the
bank of the canal.</p>

<p class='c004'>Already the sun had begun to dip below the
treetops on the horizon, but it seemed to Scott as
though it must have stuck there. Instead of the
sudden darkness which usually came with the
setting of the sun in that country, the twilight
held on and on. They both heaved a sigh of relief
when the rim of the sun finally disappeared
behind the trees and the dusk settled rapidly over
the forest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you suppose they will think when
they don’t find anything?” Murphy grinned.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Probably lick the kid for ‘seeing things’ and
let it go at that,” Scott chuckled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope he has a reputation already as a fluent
liar. That would help some. Well, what is the
big idea now?”</p>

<p class='c004'>They were still talking in whispers for they did
not know how close the boy or some of the other
searchers might be and voices carry far in the
evening stillness of the forest. They could
clearly hear the voices at the mill an eighth of a
mile away. Scott had been thinking hard of his
plan ever since they had crawled into their hiding
place and was ready with his answer to Murphy’s
question.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think that we better stay here for a while
till that fellow comes back home. Then he will
not be so likely to run up on us from behind.
When things have settled down over there we can
scout around and see how they get the lumber
out of this place, and, if possible, where they take
it. They would not dare take it back out and
down the river. Possibly we can even get close
enough to some of those logs to see if they have
your mark on them. Unless you can suggest
some better plan.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy did not have any objections to make.
There was nothing in it which suggested running
away, and there was some promise of excitement
in putting it through. They sat for a while in
silence listening for the return of the horseman
and the boy. It was almost an hour before they
heard voices on the tow path below. It was the
man on horseback and the boy half walking and
half trotting beside him. They caught enough of
the conversation to reassure them. As the pair
reached the place where the boy had been swimming
the man’s voice asked jeeringly, “Don’t see
an elephant or a hippopotamus in them bushes
now, do you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The boy was protesting vehemently with all the
breath his rapid pace had left him. They were
soon gone, but that little scrap of conversation
was as good as a promise that they would go
straight home and to bed.</p>

<p class='c004'>But they did not wait for them to go to bed.
Scott was satisfied that there was no other searching
party out and that no one would be sneaking
up behind them. They heard the people laughing
over at the camp and knew that the boy was being
teased about the horrible apparitions he had
seen.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“Well,” Scott whispered to Murphy,
“let’s get out of here and see what
we can find.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy was ready enough to move and perfectly
willing to tackle the whole camp single-handed
if necessary, but he was surprised that
Scott did not want to wait till the camp was
asleep, since he had already taken such precautions
to avoid detection. “Think they have settled
down yet?” he asked, as they crawled out of
the brush.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, but I thought we might cut a circle around
here and maybe find out how they get the lumber
out of here. We can sneak in and look over the
mill and the logs later on if we get a chance.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They took a good look at the location of the
pile of brush so that they would be able to locate
it again, and started off through the woods to the
southward. They moved cautiously so that they
would not make any noise, and would be able to
hear any one else who might be traveling the
woods that night. The sky was clear and they
could see fairly well. Before they had gone very
far they sighted a road a short distance ahead.
When they reached it they were very much surprised
to find that it was a railroad. The rails
were wooden “two-by-fours” and the ties were
slabs from the mill, but it was a railroad just the
same. They stood and gazed at it a moment in
silent wonder.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A railroad!” Murphy exclaimed softly.
“You’ve got to admire their nerve whatever you
may think of their honesty. Wouldn’t that beat
you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Imagine building a railroad to haul off stolen
goods and getting away with it for over two
years right here within a few miles of town.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If they had built a steam railroad and a bigger
mill no one would ever have found it,” Murphy
growled sarcastically. “It’s always the little fellows
who get caught. If they had just stolen a
loaf of bread or a yeast cake they would have
been caught long ago.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let’s follow it up and see where it goes,”
Scott suggested, turning down the track toward
the south.</p>

<p class='c004'>They walked in silence for some time, pondering
over the gigantic scale on which this fraud
was being conducted. There certainly must be
some clever men at the bottom of it. They had
covered about two miles when the moon peeped
over the trees and they discovered a big swamp
looming up ahead of them—a great black mass
of dense undergrowth barring their way like a
wall.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Must have been some job to put this railroad
through that swamp if it is anywhere near as big
as it looks,” Murphy remarked. “Jesse James
was little more than a piker compared with this
bunch.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The vegetation in the swamp was so dense that
it seemed almost like going into a tunnel. Gradually
their eyes became used to the darkness and
they could see a little better. A small opening
in the trees ahead let in the moonlight and Murphy
started forward with an exclamation of astonishment.
They were on a solid dirt
embankment built up there three feet at least
above the level of the swamp and ditched deep
on either side.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No half-way measures for them!” Scott exclaimed.
“They must have expected to keep this
up for a good many years to make all this worth
while.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A sudden inspiration had come to Murphy.
He was down in the ditch studying the sides of
the old dirt embankment. After a careful examination
he started up with a grunt of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now I know where I am!” he exclaimed, “or
rather where I am going.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott looked at him inquiringly. He had not
seen anything which meant anything to him. He
waited impatiently for an explanation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“These people did not build this embankment,”
Murphy explained. “It’s as old as the hills. It
is one of the first railroad embankments ever
built in the United States if it is what I think
it is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott smiled a little incredulously. He had
never heard of a railroad in Florida at a very
early date, especially in that part of it, and he
thought that he knew his history pretty well.
Murphy was too interested in what he had found
to notice him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have never seen the thing before but I have
heard of it often. It ran from Weewahitchka
up on the river to the town of St. Joseph down on
the gulf. It was built with wooden rails just like
this and the cars were pulled by niggers instead
of an engine.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What was it for?” Scott asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To get the cotton from the back country down
to the coast.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But why didn’t they take it down through the
river instead of hauling it down through this big
swamp on this expensive fill?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because there was no deep water harbor at
the mouth of the river and St. Joseph had one of
the best harbors east of Pensacola.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never heard of it,” Scott retorted. It sounded
like an improbable story, and he thought that
Murphy must be trying to string him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That may be, too. There isn’t any town there
now, but at one time it was the second largest
cotton shipping port in the United States.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Seems rather strange that it should have been
so very important and then have disappeared so
completely,” Scott protested.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was just about wiped out by cholera and
yellow fever in 1841. About that time the real
railroads began hauling the cotton to other ports
on the Atlantic coast and they never rebuilt the
old town. They moved most of the frame houses
away to other towns on the Gulf and the brick
ones went to pieces.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sounds interesting,” Scott said, finally convinced
that Murphy was at least trying to tell the
truth about it. “Now I suppose they are hauling
their lumber down over this same right-of-way
and loading it on boats in that fine harbor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s my guess,” Murphy replied. “This
old railroad embankment probably suggested it
to them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, let’s follow it up and see for ourselves,”
Scott suggested.</p>

<p class='c004'>They walked rapidly now, for there did not
seem to be much chance of meeting any one out
there in the swamp. Every now and then the
cat owls back in the shadows of the moss-covered
cypress trees burst forth into series of weird, unearthly
shrieks which made their blood run cold.
It sounded to the boys as though two or three
women were being murdered at once.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gee whiz!” Scott exclaimed, as he ducked vigorously
at an unusually explosive screech which
seemed to come from directly overhead, “this
would be a fine place for a fellow who believed in
ghosts. I wonder whether they do their hauling
at night or in the daytime?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Probably in the daytime if they have nigger
labor. They could never get a nigger into this
swamp at night, and besides, there are not half
a dozen people a year who ever come into this
country. A deer hunter now and then; nobody
else.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They had made their way through the swamp
for about three miles when the darkness of the
swamp gave way to the moonlight of an open
pine ridge. It was quite a relief to come out of
that gloom and they breathed more freely in
the open.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s that?” Murphy exclaimed, suddenly
crossing himself and pointing excitedly off into
the forest. He was actually trembling.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sudden exclamation startled Scott. The
cat owls had given him the jumps. He followed
the direction of Murphy’s gesture and saw a tall
white form apparently rising from the palmetto
scrub a short distance to one side of the right-of-way.
It was an uncanny sight and he shivered
in spite of himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let’s go see,” he whispered with a good deal
more confidence than he really felt. They had
been whispering again ever since they had entered
the swamp.</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy hesitated an instant, but followed him
closely. They picked their way cautiously
through the brush, making as little noise as possible.
They were within thirty yards of the hazy
white form which seemed now to be sinking
stealthily down into the scrub as they approached.
Scott could not make it out. He heard the faint
click of the safety lock on Murphy’s Luger. His
attention was fixed so intently on the crouching
figure that he forgot his feet. The next instant
he stepped in a hole and fell sprawling.</p>

<p class='c004'>He jumped to his feet half expecting to find
the mysterious figure ready to spring at his
throat. It had not moved. He glanced at a stick
he had picked up when he fell and dropped it in
dismay. He stared at it horrified for an instant.
It was a human bone. He relaxed with a nervous
laugh. He saw that he had stepped into a grave,
the brick top of which had fallen in and exposed
its gruesome treasure. When he realized what
it was he had no difficulty in recognizing the
ghost as a tombstone. Its apparent movement
was caused by the shadow of a palm leaf which
was waving gently before it in the breeze. It was
such a relief that he laughed aloud.</p>

<p class='c004'>He laid his hand on Murphy’s arm and was
surprised to find him trembling violently. Another
screech from the cat owls started him pattering
a prayer. Murphy was willing and ready
to fight anything human at any time regardless of
size or weight, but he was superstitious, and the
combination of cat owls and graveyard had upset
his nerves completely.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott could not help but recall the contemptuous
look which Murphy had given him back in
the boat and he was strongly tempted to remind
Murphy now that there was nothing there for a
man to be afraid of, but he needed Murphy’s help
and did not risk making him angry. However,
he enjoyed the joke just the same when Murphy
growled, “Let’s get out of here!” and beat an
almost precipitous retreat to the railroad track.</p>

<p class='c004'>Just as they were about to step out on to the
open track they stopped and stood as rigid as the
trees about them—for a voice had called in impatient
tones from no great distance, “Hello, is
that you, Bud?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Scott was thinking fast. He had to decide
on a course of action and that quickly.
Should they try to hide or should they meet
this man and trust to his being a stranger? The
voice was too close to give them much chance to
hide and the owner of it was probably a good
woodsman, thoroughly familiar with the country.
On the other hand, this man could not have received
any notice from the mill and would have
no reason to suspect them. He decided to go
ahead; he might learn something from this
stranger.</p>

<p class='c004'>He stepped out into the track and walked slowly
forward with Murphy at his elbow. They had
not gone a dozen paces when they saw two men
coming out of the woods on to the track only a
short distance ahead of them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thought I heard you over there in the brush,”
one of the men explained. “You were so late
comin’ that we started out to meet you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>By this time the man was close enough to recognize
his mistake even in that uncertain light. He
stopped short and eyed them suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thought you was some one else,” he growled.
“Where might you be from, stranger?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott evaded the question. “We did not know
where we were when we ran on to this track.
Where does it go?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where you all trying to get to?” the man countered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Old St. Joseph town,” Scott said, remembering
what Murphy had told him about the terminus
of the railroad.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man still eyed him curiously. “Ain’t no
town there now,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know there isn’t,” Scott replied. “We just
wanted to size up the harbor. Do you live here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Campin’ here,” the man said, “huntin’.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“This old railroad go there?” Scott asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man hesitated a moment. “Goes to where
the town used to be,” he said reluctantly.
“Reckon we’ll walk back with you. Man we were
lookin’ fer don’t seem to be comin’.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where was he coming from? I didn’t know
anybody ever came out this way.” The other fellow
was asking so many questions that Scott felt
justified in asking a good many himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Been out huntin’,” the man replied. “Good
many deer out this way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They moved forward and the two men moved
with them. “What’s the railroad for in this wilderness?”
Scott asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again the man hesitated so long that Scott
thought he was not going to answer at all. He
could hardly have helped hearing him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mill cuttin’ up the line haulin’ lumber down
to the harbor,” he finally answered, as though he
had weighed all the possibilities and decided to
try the truth.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Must be a pretty big outfit to afford a railroad
like this,” Scott continued.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Reckon it is,” the man replied after another
pause. He was evidently giving careful thought
to his answers.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are they located on the river?” Scott asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” the man answered promptly, “they are
nowhere near the river.” He did not seem to notice
that he had practically denied any knowledge
of the mill in his previous answer. Scott smiled
to himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>They walked in silence for a few minutes.
Scott knew they must recognize their Forest Service
uniforms when they came to the camp fire,
even if they had not already done so, and he was
trying to think of some way of accounting for
them without arousing suspicion. He finally hit
upon a plan which he thought might work.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We tried to get a boat over from Pensacola,”
he said, “but could not find any. So we came over
on the train and tried to make it cross country.
There did not seem to be any direct way of getting
here.” He thought that he could see the
man relax a little as though relieved by the information.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yonder is our camp fire,” the man said, with
a shade of cordiality creeping into his voice.
“Better come over and have a cup of coffee.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott knew that they were playing with fire,
but he did not see any way out of it. They had
neither tents nor provisions with them and were
counting on getting back to the bateau and out
of the country before morning. He decided to
accept the invitation in the hope that he could
think up later an excuse for getting away.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks,” he said, “we’ll sit down for a minute
anyway. Walking through this sand is pretty
tiresome business.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The camp fire had burned pretty low but the
man tossed on a few pieces of light wood and it
immediately flared like a torch. Scott looked curiously
around for the tent but there did not seem
to be any. It did not seem reasonable that they
should be camped there without some means of
shelter in a country where rain might be expected
any time. The gentle plashing of small waves
told him that they were close to the beach of the
harbor. Murphy and his companion had observed
a complete silence. Each was afraid to talk for
fear he would spoil the fairy tale which he knew
his friend was building up. But Murphy had
been using his eyes and he asked a question now
to call Scott’s attention to something which he
might not have seen.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the light out there on the water?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott looked toward the sound of the lapping
water and saw a light—the dim light of a lantern—bobbing
gently up and down some distance
away. He looked inquiringly at the stranger.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Schooner waiting for lumber, I reckon. She
dropped in there this afternoon,” he answered
carelessly.</p>

<p class='c004'>This gave Scott a new idea. He thought that
it probably accounted for the men not having any
tent. They had come in on the schooner and were
expecting some one from the sawmill to meet
them. It was not a pleasant discovery to make.
He had thought that they had been lucky in meeting
these men and getting so much information
from them. Now he knew that it was little short
of a calamity. Some one might drop in from the
mill at any minute now with the story of the scare
they had had up there that afternoon and it would
not take them long to add two and two together.
Their story about coming from Pensacola would
be immediately discredited and they would be definitely
identified as officers from the National Forest.
Not only that, but these fellows would know
that they had seen the mill, had come up the canal
from the river, and had learned of the source of
the logs. It was only a question now of how far
these men would go in their own defense and to
protect their future business. From the looks
of the men Scott thought they would stop at
nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ought to make a pretty cheap operation for
them,” he remarked. He spoke as carelessly as he
could, but he kept one ear turned toward the railroad
track and listened with all his might. He
accepted a cup of coffee and racked his brain
while he drank for some excuse to get away from
them, and yet he did not want to go till he had
found out who the men were who were running
that mill. He wanted a chance to talk to Murphy
to see if he had recognized any one connected
with it. He glanced out toward the light in the
harbor and was surprised to find that it had disappeared.
Then he noticed that a fog had come
in off the water while they had been sitting there
and had shut from view everything more than
twenty feet away. Scott was rather pleased to
see this, as it might give them a better chance to
get away in case there was any necessity for it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two men seemed to be content to leave
things as they were. They seemed to want their
guests to think that they were no longer suspicious
of them, but Scott noticed that they watched
them very closely and seemed to be listening as
intently as he for the approach of some one from
the direction of the sawmill. Slowly another and
unexpected sound worked its way into his consciousness.
It came from the direction of the
light he had seen in the harbor and was undoubtedly
the squeak of some rusty oarlocks. It had
never occurred to him that there might be other
men on board the schooner and that they might
come ashore. The odds were piling up against
them. He glanced at Murphy and saw that he,
too, had heard it.</p>

<p class='c004'>If he could have caught Murphy’s eye just then
he would have made a dash for it and trusted to
the fog to get away. Even while he thought of
it the boat grated on the beach. Possibly these
men would go down to meet their friends.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ready to go out, Jack?” a voice called from
the water’s edge.</p>

<p class='c004'>Neither of the men answered at once. Then
the one who had been talking to Scott spoke up
quietly: “Not yet, come on over to the fire.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott knew now that they were virtually prisoners.
These men intended to keep them right
where they were till the messenger or whoever it
was came from the mill and helped them to decide
whether it was safe to turn them loose after
what they had found out. He knew very well
what the decision would be, but there was no way
out of it now. They could fight about as well one
time as another and he decided to stay and see
what would happen. It would at least give them
a chance to identify some one from the mill and
possibly learn something more about this mysterious
crew.</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy evidently thought that the time for
action had arrived or was rapidly approaching.
He kept Scott in the corner of his eye all the time
now to catch any possible signal and toyed absent-mindedly
with the flap of his holster. The
man beside him was watching his every motion
with his own rifle resting conveniently across
his knees and his fingers toying with the trigger
guard. It was evidently a case of armed truce all
around.</p>

<p class='c004'>They could hear the other men approaching
through the wire grass and they soon stepped out
into the firelight. There they stopped and gazed
curiously at the unexpected guests. Then they
looked inquiringly at the man called Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Couple of fellows from Pensacola,” he explained,
“who have come over here to inspect the
harbor. They was lost up here on the right-of-way
when we found ’em.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott nodded as pleasantly as he could in acknowledgment
of the introduction, but Murphy
only stared at them sullenly. The two newcomers
took their places around the fire and they all
sat in silence—waiting. The fog had thickened
about them till they could see nothing outside the
immediate circle of the firelight; the call of the
cat owls still came to them faintly from the distant
swamp and the waves lapped on the beach
with a melancholy monotony which was getting
on Scott’s nerves. He was beginning to wish
that something would happen just to break the
tension.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then it came. There was a crunching of heavy
boots in the sand and a figure loomed suddenly
up out of the fog close on them. He was evidently
somewhat dazzled by the firelight and did
not notice that there were strangers present.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Couldn’t make it any sooner, boys,” he apologized.
“One of the cars got off the track and
we had to unload the lumber to get back on, but
they are started now and will be here before
long.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott had recognized him the instant he spoke
as the superintendent of the turpentine camp.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>For a minute which seemed like an hour
Scott stared at Roberts with every nerve
on edge and every muscle tense. He had
not the least idea what would happen when they
were recognized, but he felt pretty sure that something
would happen and he was prepared for any
emergency. Murphy also was watching him
keenly. He had not liked Scott’s caution in hiding
up there at the camp or his failure to attack
these two men when they first met them up on
the railroad. He had recognized that they were
virtually prisoners when these men had started
to lead them back to their camp and he had wanted
to fight then, but he had not wanted to cross
Scott’s plans. Now he had decided that he would
wait no longer. If he saw a good opportunity he
was going to try to fight his way out. He did not
expect to get very much help in that line from
Scott. He recognized his ability in many things,
but he did not consider that fighting was one of
his accomplishments.</p>

<p class='c004'>In a moment Roberts’ eyes had become accustomed
to the light and the next instant he recognized
Scott. His lip curled in a malicious sneer
and his hand stole up toward the holster on his
belt. He glanced from Scott to Murphy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So the kid was right,” he snarled. “He said
there were a couple of sneaks in the canal this
afternoon and we all thought that he was dreaming.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Seems to me you are quite a ways from home
yourself, Mr. Roberts,” Scott remarked quietly.
He saw they were in for it now and he thought
that he might as well anger Roberts to see what
he would say. He also watched him keenly to see
what he would do. He remembered the frog he
had seen this man shoot at the turpentine camp
and he did not want to give him too good an opportunity
to display his skill now.</p>

<p class='c004'>Roberts glared at him with a fierce hatred
which he did not try to disguise. “Not so far
away from home as you will go when you leave
here,” he hissed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You don’t seem to be as glad to see visitors
here as you do at the turpentine camp,” Scott
mocked. “It must have spoiled your temper to
have to work so hard reloading that stolen lumber.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy saw the blood surge through the swollen
veins of Roberts’ neck and saw his hand spring
convulsively toward his automatic. He saw the
time for action had come and gathered himself
for a spring.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Scott was ahead of him. He had long ago
prepared himself for just such a situation. He
shot from the ground as though he had been sitting
on a spring. Just as Roberts had drawn his
revolver from its holster Scott struck him a tremendous
blow on the point of the chin and
knocked him sprawling. He had struck blows
like that before and knew that there was no need
to waste any more time on Roberts who would
not be in a condition to do any damage for some
time to come, so he turned his attention to the man
beside him who had been doing all the talking
before Roberts came.</p>

<p class='c004'>The attack on Roberts had been so sudden and
unexpected that it had somewhat dazed the rest
of the party. Murphy had been so astonished by
Scott’s sudden action that he had lost a valuable
instant and in that instant the man beside him
had hurled himself upon him bearing him to the
ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Go for ’em, Murphy,” Scott shouted, as he
turned to the second man who was scrambling to
his feet with his rifle in his hand. But the man
never had a chance to use the rifle. Just as he
straightened up Scott caught him with an upper
cut that sent him spinning. His rifle fell at his
feet. Scott saw the other two men of the crew
rushing upon him. He waited till the last instant
as though he was watching the man on the
ground and then side-stepped the first of the two
with the agility of a cat, tripped him as he went
past and met the second one with a terrific blow
between the eyes, and followed it with a right
swing which felled him like an ox. The man
Scott had tripped had picked himself up now and
was returning to the fight with renewed fury.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no time to lose. Scott dropped suddenly
on the rifle at his feet and let the man trip
over him again. Then grasping the rifle by the
end of the barrel he ran to Murphy’s assistance.
He saw the gleam of a knife in the firelight and
it almost sickened him. He swung wildly with
the butt of the rifle and struck the man’s wrist,
sending the knife flying. The rifle swung on
through a second circle and came down on the
man’s neck with a sickening thud.</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy was unhurt and furious. He sprang
to his feet and tore at the only remaining one of
the crew who was rushing at Scott once more,
armed with a stick of firewood. Maddened by
the knowledge that he had been blocked out of
the fight by a man half his size and largely by his
own fault because he had allowed that man to
get the jump on him, Murphy paid no more attention
to the club which the man had than if it
had been a straw. He brushed it aside and literally
bore the man to the earth under the fury
of his onslaught. He was proceeding to pound
him in true Irish fashion when Scott interfered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let him go, Murphy!” he shouted. “Grab
Roberts’ revolver and come ahead. We’ve got to
get out of here, there is no telling how soon those
fellows may come from the mill with that lumber.”
He snatched up the other rifle and started
down the beach.</p>

<p class='c004'>A little time before Murphy might have accused
Scott of cowardice for running away from
the fighting field in this way, but he had no such
notion now. He obediently left the man whom
he had been pounding with such satisfaction,
caught up the automatic from the ground beside
Roberts and joined Scott. Except when Scott
had spoken and a single roar of rage from Murphy
when the man had unexpectedly thrown himself
upon him, they had fought in utter silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>Loaded down with their captured arms, they
hurried along the beach toward the east. Looking
back they could see some crumpled figures
beginning to move painfully about the fire. They
had not gone very far when they came to the
railroad track and they had not much more than
crossed it when they heard the creak of the cars
of lumber. They had gotten away just in time.
If they had waited five minutes more, four men
would have been added to their opponents and
the odds would have been hopeless.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shall we stick around a while and see what
happens?” Scott whispered, “or do you think we
better get a little farther away while the getting
is good?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t see what more we can learn here,” Murphy
replied, “unless we sneak back there and
shoot the whole bunch. We have guns enough
here now to do it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing to be gained by that now. But I
would like to hear what those fellows have got
to say and what their plans are. It will be a lot
easier for us if we know what they are going to
do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Seems to me that we better beat it back as
fast as we can and get out some warrants for
these fellows before they can get out of the country,”
Murphy suggested.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can’t do it,” Scott replied with decision. “If
they are going to leave the country at all—as
they certainly will—they will be gone long before
we can get to town and there will be no way to
trace them. Besides there may be other people
mixed up in this thing whom we ought to get, and
unless we find out from these men who they are
there will be no way of getting them. The other
fellows will lie mighty low when they find out
that their little scheme has been discovered. No,
we can’t leave them now. You stay here and
wait while I sneak back there and see if I can
find out what they are planning.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing doing,” Murphy cried emphatically.
“If you go back there I am going with you. Do
you think I would let you go back there among
that bunch of cutthroats alone?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know it is too bad to miss it, Murphy, but
that would not do at all. Two of us could not
hear any more than one and if anything happened
to us there would not be any one to take
back the news and these men could go right on
with their little business just as they have been
doing for the past two years.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It would not take Graham long to find out
that we were missing,” Murphy grumbled, “and,
believe me, he would turn this outfit inside out
in pretty short order when he got started.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Judging from the looks of him I guess you
are right,” Scott agreed, “but he does not know
where we went, does not know anything about
this outfit, and would not have a clue to guide
him. We have been two years finding this place
and he might be two more in finding it again.
No, Murphy, my plan is the only sensible thing
to do. I know how you feel and I am sorry that
you cannot go. If it were just for fun it would
be all right, but we are trying to clean this up
for the government and it would not be right to
risk losing all the advantage we have gained.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy was forced to admit that it was the
only safe thing to do and grudgingly consented
to stay behind. He made a plea to go in Scott’s
place, but, of course, Scott could not agree to
that. He felt that he was directly responsible
for the capture of these timber thieves and he
could not very well turn it over to any one else.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s the way to look at it,” he said, trying
to comfort Murphy, “and now let’s make sure
that we understand each other. I am going
back there to see if I can find out what they are
planning to do. You are going to wait right
here till I come back or you are sure that I am
not coming back. Remember you are not to come
over there no matter what kind of a row you hear
or what you may think has happened to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is asking a good deal of a fellow,” Murphy
objected, “and I don’t know whether I can
do it or not.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You must do it,” Scott insisted. “We cannot
take the risk of having them pot both of us.
That is just what they want. If for any reason
you feel sure that anything has happened to me,
beat it for headquarters as fast as you can go
and notify Mr. Graham. Then he will know
where to come and where to look. He can probably
trace them with hounds or some other way
if he knows just where to begin and can get on
the trail right away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right,” Murphy agreed, “but it will be the
hardest job I ever had to do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then it is all settled,” Scott said quickly, without
giving Murphy time to think anything more
about it or to raise any more objections. “It may
be a long time before I can get back, but unless
you hear an awful rumpus, wait for me. So
long.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The two men shook hands earnestly and Scott
turned back toward the camp fire which they
could still see—a dull red spark in the distance.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hold on,” Murphy whispered, “you haven’t
any gun. Better take my automatic; it is handier
than one of those rifles, and they might not
be in shape anyway.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott shook his head. “I’ve never learned to
use a gun and would be almost as apt to shoot
myself as the other fellow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy looked at him in amazement. “Well,
I’ll admit that you seem to be able to take pretty
good care of yourself without one, but I suppose
you know that any one of those fellows back there
would not think any more of shooting you in the
back than they would of shooting a yellow dog,
and it is tempting Providence to go down there
without a gun of some kind. Take one of the
rifles then, you can shoot that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It would only be in my way. I’ve just got to
keep out of sight. If they should see me one gun
would not do me much good against so many.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then let me go along and have two guns,”
Murphy begged.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott saw that he would simply have the whole
argument to do over again if he stayed there so
he simply shook his head and moved off into the
night. He had been brought up in the East in
the atmosphere of an old New England town
where the use of a gun in a fight was never heard
of and he had developed a dislike for it which he
had never overcome even after a year of life in
the Southwest. At one time out there when he
had looked for an instant into the barrel of a .45
and had realized with sickening force how helpless
an unarmed man was in the face of a deadly
weapon he had decided to arm himself. But the
shock of that encounter had hardly worn off when
he changed his mind. It seemed to him such a
cowardly way to fight. He had boxed all his life
and was not afraid to stand up to any man, but to
shoot a human being and possibly kill him had
always seemed beyond him. There were times
like the present when he wished that he could use
a gun, but as soon as the excitement was over and
he had a chance to consider the question calmly
he revolted against it.</p>

<p class='c004'>To Murphy who had always lived in a society
where nearly every one “toted” a gun, Scott’s position
was altogether incomprehensible. It
seemed to him that Scott was simply courting
death to go into such a place as that unarmed,
and he was strongly tempted to break his promise
and go after him. He thought a whole lot
more of Scott since he had seen him in that fight
there at the camp fire. It was the most wonderful
fight he had ever seen. This man whose
courage he had doubted had overcome four men
and rescued him from the fifth. He sat in the
sand with his back against a tree and thought it
over.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>In the meanwhile Scott was moving cautiously
along the beach in the direction of
the camp fire. The fog had grown denser
and he had to rely on his hearing for anything
more than a few feet from him. The moon was
completely blotted out but there was very little
chance of going astray with the water lapping the
beach on one side of him and the camp fire showing
as a dull blur ahead. When he stumbled on
to the railroad track he stopped and listened intently
for a long time. He always had a dread of
some one slipping up behind him and felt much
safer if he was sure that all his enemies were
ahead of him. He did not know how many men
there were at the mill or how many had come
down with the lumber, and there was always the
possibility that some more might come straggling
in from that direction.</p>

<p class='c004'>He caught no sound save the weird screeching
of the cat owls back in the swamp and crept on
toward the growing light of the camp fire. He
was close enough now to catch the blur of shadows
passing between him and the fire and hear
the rumble of sullen voices. He remembered
seeing a clump of brush a little way from the fire
on the side away from the beach and decided that
his best chance would be to circle around inland
and crawl up behind it. There was little chance
of detection unless he should run on to one of
those stragglers whom he so much dreaded, for
the fog was dense enough to pretty well conceal
anything outside of the immediate circle of the
firelight.</p>

<p class='c004'>His feet made no sound in the soft sand, but
he had to move very cautiously to avoid the chance
of striking a dead stick or a tin can. He was so
close to them now that the slightest sound might
give him away. He had completed his circle and
was crawling slowly forward toward the clump
of bushes when his heart seemed suddenly to
stop beating and he stood frozen in his tracks.
The black stub not more than six feet away and
on which he had been directing his course had
moved.</p>

<p class='c004'>Had it really moved or was it another case of
a waving palm leaf like the one which had fooled
them back in the cemetery? He waited, hardly
daring to breathe to see whether it would move
again. He had a harrowing suspicion that it
might be a man who had been watching him and
was preparing to spring upon him as soon as he
came within range. He argued that it could not
be a man, for one of these men would shoot on
sight and not wait to come to close quarters; they
had probably had enough of that. But he might
not be sure whether it was friend or foe and be
waiting on that account.</p>

<p class='c004'>The suspense was frightful, and it seemed to
him that he had been crouching in that same
cramped position for hours. He had just about
decided that he had again been fooled by a stump
when the object moved again. His first instinct
was to lie flat on the ground to avoid detection,
but he realized that that would put him in an
utterly helpless position and he decided to wait
as he was and be ready for anything. Unless the
man did shoot he would stand a very good show
of dodging him and losing himself in the fog.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man came so close that Scott could almost
have reached out and touched him. Every muscle
in his body was as tense as a steel spring and
he could hardly hold himself, it seemed so certain
that the only sensible thing to do was to
strike first and save himself. The figure passed
slowly by and took its place in the sullen circle
around the fire. Scott heaved a great sigh of
relief and moved a little nearer. He felt that he
had to get close enough to recognize the speakers
and hear distinctly what was said or he would
have accomplished very little by his eavesdropping.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last he reached his little clump of bushes
and peeped cautiously through them at the council
of war which was sitting so close before him.
They had piled the fire high with driftwood and
Scott could make out the faces quite distinctly.
He had no trouble in recognizing the five with
whom they had fought a few minutes before,
but there were four others there now. Evidently
they were the men who had brought down the
lumber cars. Two of them were sitting with their
backs to him. Roberts seemed to be the leader
of the gang. He was standing on the opposite
side of the fire facing Scott and the others were
apparently looking to him for orders. He was
staring silently at the fire now with an expression
of bitter hatred and Scott noticed with satisfaction
that his lower lip was cut and bleeding.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly he raised his head and glared fiercely
around the circle. “We’ve got to get ’em, I tell
you. If they ever get back to town or headquarters
with that story our business will be cooked
and we’ll be more than likely to go to the pen.
What good will all the money we’ve made do us
then? They can’t get away from us if we keep
our eyes open. They don’t know the country
well enough to travel it very fast and Mike would
get back to the canal long before they could.
They would probably try to go that way because
they have their boat right there somewhere—the
boy saw them this afternoon. If they try to go
the other way they don’t know the road. They
would follow the beach and would have to cut
away inland to get around the swamp. We can
hide up there at the head of the swamp and pot
them dead easy. There is not one chance in a
hundred of their getting by us because we know
every foot of the country and they don’t. They
are in a regular bottle here and there are enough
of us here to cover the neck so that a squirrel
could not get through.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You can count us out on that stuff,” said the
man who had been the spokesman there that evening
before Roberts arrived and was evidently
the skipper of the schooner.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the matter with you?” Roberts
sneered. “You’re about as much interested in
this thing as we are. You’ll lose a pretty business
if they blow on our game.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The man shrugged his shoulders. “I came
over here to get a load of lumber, not to help
murder anybody. If I can’t get a load here I can
get one somewhere else. It may not pay quite so
big but it will be a lot safer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Roberts glared at him angrily for a moment.
He had no scruples himself and the probable loss
of the tremendous booty he was getting in those
stolen logs made him almost beyond himself with
rage. He did not dare speak at first because he
knew if he did he would surely say something
which would very likely turn these men against
him and if they wanted to they could do him
quite as much harm as the forest officers. He
swallowed hard and finally succeeded in getting
sufficient control of himself to speak with apparent
calmness, but inside he was almost burning
up with rage.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If that is the way you feel about it,” he managed
to say quietly, “you better leave now before
you know any more about it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Guess you’re about right,” the skipper said,
rising slowly and speaking to his men. “Come
on, boys, there is not likely to be much more lumber
going out of this port.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Might as well load on what is already at the
dock,” said one of the men who was sitting with
his back to Scott.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, thank you,” the skipper replied. “I have
a hunch that by the time I got to market with
that lumber there might be some inquiries about
it that would make it hard to sell.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t forget that we have a pretty good notion
where to find you if there should ever be any
need of it,” Roberts called after him as the crew
disappeared into the fog in the direction of the
boat.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not likely to brag much about my connection
with this end of the business, unless I
am forced to,” the skipper called back.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was the sound of a keel grating on the
sand as the men pushed the boat into the water
and the splashing of oars told that they were already
on their way back to their schooner. For
a few moments the men who were left gazed
around the fire in silence, listening sullenly to the
retreating sound of the oars. They were discouraged
by the defection from their ranks, but
were, if possible, in an uglier mood than before.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Chicken-livered scoundrels,” Roberts muttered,
breaking the silence. “If they ever peach
on us they will have hoisted their last sail. I’d
get him if I had the noose around my neck.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can’t hang us for stealing a little lumber,”
one of the other men answered rather uncertainly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe you better get out of this bunch, too,
if you are getting scared,” Roberts sneered, and
the man was silent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” Roberts continued, “what are we going
to do about it? What do you think of it,
Qualley?”</p>

<p class='c004'>At that unexpected name Scott started so violently
that he felt sure they had heard him. He
could hardly believe his eyes when the man addressed
as Qualley arose and he recognized him
as the foreman of the logging camp. It seemed
incredible that a man could be such a scoundrel
as this man seemed to be—stealing on a gigantic
scale from the company who employed him. And
all the time for the past two years he had been
helping Murphy to hunt for the thieves while he
helped the thieves to get away with the logs.</p>

<p class='c004'>From his attitude it was evident that Qualley
was a partner in the deal with Roberts. “There
is only one thing we can do now,” he said, “get
those two fellows before they get away with the
news. We have too much at stake to take any
chance on them spoiling it all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then, let’s get busy!” Roberts exclaimed. He
rubbed his hand gently over his bleeding lip and
seemed to take considerable satisfaction in the
prospect of the work ahead of him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hold on a minute,” Qualley said quietly. “I
am just as anxious to get busy as you are, but
there are one or two things we ought to settle
before we start. What are we going to do if
they should get away from us?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t see any chance for them to get away,”
Roberts objected a little nervously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” Qualley agreed, “it does not seem as
though they could, but there is a bare possibility
of it and I would like to get it decided now what
we are going to do if they do. The government
has a mighty long arm and they will be after us
pretty hard if they find out about this business.
We ought to have some plan.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s your plan?” Roberts asked. Qualley
was evidently the brains of the party and they
looked to him for leadership.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” Qualley replied thoughtfully, “I’ve
been thinking it over and I would suggest something
like this: if they do get through us and
make their way straight back to headquarters
they will have to follow the beach, because there
is no way for them to get to their boat with Mike
up there watching the canal. It will be at least
two days before they can get back. Why not lay
for them till to-morrow night? If we have not
gotten them by that time it will be because they
have gotten by somehow. Then we will know
what we are up against. You can go way back in
the swamp there to that old cabin—the dogs can’t
trail you there—and I’ll go back to the logging
camp where I can keep my eye on things and
maybe help them hunt.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What makes you think they will not take
you?” Roberts asked in surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why should they? They have not seen me
and do not know that I have been mixed up in it
at all. I have helped Murphy hunt for the timber
thieves so much that he will probably tell me all
about it; may ask me to help him out. Then I
would have a fine chance to lead them astray.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How long do you expect us to stay cooped up
in that cabin? I’d rather be in the penitentiary
than to try to live in that place for the rest of
my life, especially if you are out loose and going
where you please.” Roberts was not at all satisfied
with the arrangement.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, what do you want to do?” Qualley asked
indifferently. “Make a run for it if you want to,
but I think you will have a good deal better chance
if you lay low for a while, say a month or two,
and then try it. It may have blown over a little
by that time and they may not be watching so
close.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The plan evidently did not appeal to Roberts.
It galled him to think that he might be in a trap
while Qualley was not even under suspicion.
Scott saw the look of sullen craft on his face and
thought that he would not give much for Qualley’s
chances if Roberts was ever taken. Probably
either one of them would cheerfully watch
the other hang if he thought it would improve his
own chances any.</p>

<p class='c004'>No one seemed to be able to think of a better
scheme and Roberts finally agreed to it grudgingly.
“Let’s be going,” he said. “Unless I miss
my guess we’ll have both those would-be detectives
bagged before to-morrow night and there
will not be any need of anybody hiding in the
swamp.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Qualley arose energetically and stretched himself.
“I hope you are right and I don’t see why
you shouldn’t be. Joe, you go up and tell Mike
to stay on the job there watching that canal until
he gets further orders. If they get by him it may
mean several years in the pen for him, so he better
look sharp. The rest of us will take the short
cut across the swamp to the neck and you can
join us there as soon as you can make it. The
four of us ought to be able to cover that swamp
so that a rabbit could not get through.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They moved slowly away toward the track
and Scott chuckled when he heard Roberts call
to Joe, “Stop at the camp on your way over and
bring me a gun. Those scoundrels stole mine.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Scott waited till they had disappeared in
the fog and then followed cautiously. Suddenly
an idea came to him that made the
cold chills run up his back. What if they should
go over past Murphy and Murphy should mistake
them for him? If they would just keep on talking
it might be all right, but if they walked in
silence Murphy would be almost certain to hail
them.</p>

<p class='c004'>He crept up as close behind them as he dared
so that if the worst came he would be there to
help Murphy. For the second time in his life he
sorely regretted that he did not have a gun. If
there was trouble, Murphy would probably be
shot before he could get near enough to do anything.
If he had only taken Murphy’s advice
and his pistol he could at least cause a diversion
even if he could not hit anything.</p>

<p class='c004'>Joe had turned off to follow the track to the
camp but the rest of them went steadily on down
the beach directly toward Murphy. They had
apparently exhausted their ideas in the talk
around the camp fire for they had fallen silent
now, just what Scott had dreaded. He thought
they must be pretty close to Murphy now and
he expected every instant to hear his voice. If
they would only say something. A sudden inspiration
came to him and he deliberately kicked
a tree he was passing and stopped behind it. He
was listening breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What was that?” Qualley asked in a quiet
voice. “Did you hear anything?”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a pause and then Roberts answered,
“Yes, I heard it. Must have been a pine cone
dropping or those cowards out there on the
schooner locking their back door.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott heaved a sigh of relief. Certainly Murphy
must have heard that if he was not asleep.
It was not likely that a man would go to sleep
under those circumstances, but the idea worried
Scott and he knew that he could not feel comfortable
again till he had joined Murphy and put him
wise to the situation. It had never occurred to
him before he left Murphy that there might be
some one else wandering around there and they
had not arranged any signals for recognition.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were all moving again now and he felt
certain that they must have passed the place
where he had left Murphy. He stopped and listened
in silence till long after all sound of the
rest of them had died away in the distance. He
waited a moment longer and then hissed cautiously.
The response was so immediate and so
close that he almost jumped out of his skin.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Begorra,” Murphy exclaimed in a relieved
tone as he stepped out from behind a tree close
beside Scott, “that’s the first time I ever pointed
a loaded gun at a friend, but you been looking
down the barrel of my old Luger for the last five
minutes and didn’t know it. If you had not made
some signal or something pretty quick I’d have
blown up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gee!” Scott exclaimed, grasping Murphy’s
hand and sitting suddenly on the ground, “I think
I would have felt better if you had shot me. I
have been so afraid you would hail those other
fellows when they came along that it has just
about made me sick. I feel as limp as a dishrag.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I came mighty near doing just that thing,
too,” Murphy replied cheerfully. “I had my
mouth all puckered up to ask you what had kept
you so long when one of them spoke. I was already
sitting down or I would have dropped same
as you did.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was wishing mighty hard that I had taken
your pistol as you wanted me to. I saw my mistake
when I discovered that those fellows might
run on to you here in the dark, shoot you and
have it all over before I could ever get near
enough to them to do anything.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pretty handy thing to have when you are
dealing with a bunch like that,” Murphy said.
“But tell me all about it. Where have you been
all this time and what happened? Where are
those guys going?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott thought a second. “It’s a pretty long
story but I guess this is as good a place to tell it
as any unless we want to hurry on after those fellows
and get ourselves shot.” He went on to
tell Murphy all that he had overheard at the camp
fire, how their retreat was already cut off from
the canal, and how those men who had just passed
were on their way to head them off and shoot
them if they attempted to make their way around
the head of the swamp. When he mentioned
Qualley’s name Murphy almost cried aloud.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To think of the hours that old scoundrel has
sat down there in the brush with me and watched
to see if he could catch himself stealing logs out
of that pond!” Murphy exclaimed angrily. “If
I ever catch up with him I’ll punch his head for
that if it is my last act.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now the question for us to decide,” Scott said
thoughtfully, “is what we are going to do? How
are we going to get out of this place? We have
been two years getting in here and it looks as
though we might be a long time getting out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy thought about it for a moment. “We
might go west from here instead of east as they
expect us to and then go north cross-country till
we strike the main line railroad. It would be a
long way around and I do not know anything
about that country. No telling how many swamps
we would get tangled up in or whom we might
meet on the way, but it ought to be fairly safe.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought of the possibility of that,” Scott
replied. “Of course, they do not know that we
know anything about their plan to head us off.
They know that we do not know much about this
country here and will not know that we are going
across a narrow little neck of land where they
cannot miss us. They did not seem to think of the
possibility of our going around the other way;
maybe it was because you cannot get around that
way. At any rate it would take us a long time
and the plan does not appeal to me much. I am
in favor of having a look at the swamp and seeing
if we cannot figure out some way of getting
across it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let’s try it,” Murphy exclaimed enthusiastically,
“even if we can’t make it, it will be shorter
to wait till they go home than to make a trip
around the world as we would have to do if we
went west. They only planned to wait for us till
to-morrow night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So they decided to follow the beach down to
the edge of  the swamp and try it. They started
down the beach, moving rather cautiously and
stopping to listen every few minutes, for they did
not know that the other men had not stopped
along there somewhere and they did not care to
run on to them unexpectedly. Scott glanced at
his wrist watch. The little luminous hands
pointed to half-past eleven. The fog was beginning
to fade away. Before they had gone very
far the night was clear once more and it seemed
almost as light as day.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That fog must have come on for our special
benefit,” Scott whispered. They had become so
accustomed to whispering that they did not seem
to be able to stop it.</p>

<p class='c004'>They thought they were a little too conspicuous
on the open beach and turned back into the edge
of the woods where they could see everything on
the beach without being seen. The soil was so
sandy and the ground so free from underbrush
that they made very little noise. What little
breeze there was was blowing in their faces.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly they caught sight of a moving object
in the woods ahead of them. They stopped instantly
and watched it with bated breath. They
could not quite make it out, but it was moving
towards the beach and they knew they would
soon have a look at it in the moonlight of the
open. Whatever it was it did not seem to be in
any hurry. It moved jerkily and stopped so long
sometimes that they almost lost track of it. It
looked like a man crouching and sneaking along
as though stalking something. If it had been
coming in their direction they would have been
badly worried, and even as it was Murphy had
examined his rifle two or three times to make
sure that it was in working condition.</p>

<p class='c004'>When it finally stepped out into the moonlight
they looked at each other with a sigh of relief.
It was a doe and she seemed wholly unconscious
of the presence of any enemy. She walked leisurely
and sedately enough until she came to the
edge of the water and then the moonlight seemed
to go to her head. She twitched her white tail
once or twice and suddenly began cavorting
around like a calf at play. She pranced aimlessly
this way and that, tossing her head and kicking
up her heels till the shallow water shone in the
moonlight like a shimmering puddle of fire. It
was the first time Scott had ever seen the phosphorescent
sparkle of salt water and it seemed to
him like magic or some fairy business. Every
time her slender legs cut the still water they left
a trail of flame. It was a wonderful exhibition
of unconscious grace and even the practical Murphy
looked on in silent admiration.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last one of her sudden dashes took her to
leeward of them and she caught the man-scent.
One sniff was enough. She did not stop to investigate
further. With flag erect and head held
high she seemed to rise from the water like a
bird and a couple of wonderful bounds carried her
quickly into the protecting shadows of the forest.
They could hear her going for a moment and
then a clear, sharp, whistling snort from far back
in the woods told them that she had stopped to
see if she were followed. Another snort and a
snapping of dead branches showed that she was
not yet satisfied with the distance between them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Must smell pretty bad to her,” Scott laughed.
“Did you ever see anything prettier than that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If it had not been for those fellows out there
in the brush, and if it were not out of season she
would have come in awful handy for a midnight
lunch. It seems to me like a hundred years since
I had anything to eat.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you had taken a shot at her it might have
been more than a hundred years before you
would have eaten again,” Scott retorted in disgust.
He could not understand how a man could
look at such a sight as that and think only of
shooting. “There is no telling how close we may
be to that bunch.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They had covered about three miles when the
pine woods ended abruptly at a little creek and
beyond it was a black and forbidding swamp.
The undergrowth was dense and tangled and
under it they could catch the gleam of the moonlight
in the water.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gee!” Murphy exclaimed, “I’d hate to tackle
that place in the dark. Looks as though it might
be a pretty hopeless proposition even in the daytime.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The prospect was, indeed, discouraging. They
had no idea how wide the swamp might be or how
deep the water might be in parts of it. Some of
those swamps were easy wading, not more than
three feet deep, but in others there was as much
as ten or twelve feet of water. Scott sized it
up as best he could and came to the conclusion
that a passage through it at night would be impossible
and he doubted very much if the daylight
would be a very big help.</p>

<p class='c004'>He glanced thoughtfully out across the calm
and shining waters of the bay. “How far can
you swim, Murphy?” he asked suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Quite a ways down if the water is deep
enough,” Murphy retorted, “but I don’t make
much progress ahead.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can’t you swim at all?” Scott asked incredulously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No more than a stone. Why, were you thinking
of swimming to town?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, not quite that, but I was wondering how
far it was to that lighthouse out there. Maybe
we could get a boat from them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy looked at the winking light in dismay.
“Well, it’s pretty hard to judge distance across
the water, but I should say that light was at least
four or five miles out. No, it would be considerably
quicker for me to wait till to-morrow night
when those fellows will have left for their retreat
in the swamp.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We might not gain very much time in going
across there,” Scott admitted, “but to tell the
truth I do not like the prospect of going up around
the head of this swamp and across that narrow
neck of land even after to-morrow night. Those
fellows may change their minds and decide to
stay there a little longer. They would hate to
lose us and they might decide to stay a little longer
or leave Qualley there to watch another day or
so. I don’t so much mind a danger I can see, but
I hate to have somebody hanging around in the
bushes watching me. At any rate, I don’t suppose
that a day or so would make much difference
to us. We know where they are going to
hide and we could find them there next week just
as well as now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Guess that’s right,” Murphy replied slowly,
“but if there is any chance of our staying here
for two or three days I am going back there now
and take a shot at that deer no matter who may
hear it. They say the buds of these palmettoes
are good to eat but I never thought much of
them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott had a sudden inspiration. “I have it!”
he exclaimed. “There must be a hard strip of
beach along the edge of that swamp. The tide
would build it up there in spite of the swamp.
I’ll bet they never thought of that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They both ran eagerly forward and waded the
creek. It was not more than knee-deep. They
were about in the middle of the stream when
Murphy looked nervously over his shoulder toward
the dark woods behind them. “I wonder if
this is the narrow neck they were going to wait
for us to cross?” he questioned.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was an unpleasant thought and they both
ran a little faster. Scott was involuntarily writhing
his body back and forth as though he could
already feel the bullet in his back. Murphy evidently
felt the same way about it and his Irish
philosophy expressed Scott’s thoughts exactly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wonder why it is,” he soliloquized as he
ducked back and forth, “that a fellow would always
so much rather be shot some place else than
the place where he thinks he is going to be?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott was too busy to answer him. They would
not have had nearly so far to wade if they had
gone down on to the beach before they took to
the water, but they had been so eager to test out
their new idea that they had jumped right in up
there in the woods. The swamp was opposite
them there and they had to wade down till they
came to the beach. Murphy’s suggestion that
this might be the spot where their enemy was
waiting for them had disturbed them so that they
were both running through the water now and
wondering how they ever got so far away from
the beach.</p>

<p class='c004'>They almost shouted when they rounded the
farthest projection of the swamp brush and saw
a broad, smooth beach stretching out before them.
It seemed too good to be true. They made a mad
dash toward it to put that point of brush between
them and the imaginary rifles they had conjured
up behind them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott reached it first and fell sprawling on his
face. He thought for an instant that he had been
shot, but he had not heard anything and it felt
more as though some one had caught his foot.
He had not yet realized what had happened when
Murphy landed beside him with a grunt. He put
out his hands to lift himself up and gasped with
astonishment when he saw them disappear in the
smooth sand. His feet seemed to be caught
under something and he pushed up his body with
his arms to investigate. He was yanked unceremoniously
back on to his face. Out of the corner
of his eye he saw Murphy go through almost
the same contortions.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thoroughly frightened now he pulled viciously
at one hand. It came slowly and heavily from
the reluctant sand. Then something seemed to
give way in his head. “Quicksand!” he shrieked,
and began to struggle with the frenzy of madness.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Weariness, lack of sleep, extraordinary
exertion and the tremendous
nervous strain under which he had
been for the past forty-eight hours had been too
much for Scott’s nerves. Now the realization
that he was caught in one of those death traps of
which he had read such horrible things and actually
seen so little had broken him up completely.
He lost all control of himself and struggled
blindly. Left to himself he would undoubtedly
have quickly exhausted his strength and have
been slowly buried beneath those treacherous,
quivering sands.</p>

<p class='c004'>To Murphy it had appeared a very different
proposition. He had seen many quicksands, and
when once the first explosion of exasperation was
over his downfall struck him as a good deal of a
joke. He mistook Scott’s raving for a burst of
anger and that made him laugh all the more. He
had worked his way out of the quicksand and
stepped back on to the solid ground before he
realized what a condition Scott was really in.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly it came to him. With a single bound
he was back beside the struggling man whose ineffective
writhing had already worked his arms
into the sand to the elbow. He grabbed Scott
by the shoulders and lifted with all his might.
He could feel his own feet sinking, but that did
not worry him; he continued to pull. Slowly
Scott’s arms were drawn from the grasping
sands. As soon as the hands were free he shook
his burden violently.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Brace up, old man, and come out of it. You’re
all right. Stop that struggling and we can walk
right out of here. Stop it, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>At first Scott did not seem to hear him. He
continued to struggle and beat the air wildly even
after his hands were clear, but gradually Murphy’s
voice seemed to reach him as from a great
distance and he looked at him in a dazed fashion
like a man coming out of a nightmare.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are all right now,” Murphy reassured
him. “We’ll be out of here in a minute. Pull
up slowly on one foot while I steady you. It will
come hard, but it will come all right if you keep
at it. Don’t try to do it quick; you can’t do it
that way. Just pull slowly and steadily. Feel it
coming?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott did not feel it coming at first, and for an
instant he was on the verge of falling back into
another fit of terror, but he managed to control
himself and was rewarded by feeling his foot
breaking slowly from the reluctantly yielding
sand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s the stuff,” Murphy encouraged. “Now
the other one. Comes hard, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>It certainly did come hard and Scott felt as
nearly utterly exhausted as he ever had in his
life, but he had recovered his nerve and continued
to pull doggedly. The perspiration stood in
beads on his forehead and he could feel his
strength oozing out of him. At last, after what
seemed like a lifetime of desperate effort, the foot
was free.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now walk slowly out there on to solid
ground,” Murphy advised him. “Don’t try to
hurry or you may fall again. It will be sort of
hard to lift your feet, but they will come.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was needless to advise Scott not to hurry.
He could not have hurried if his life had depended
on it. Laboriously he worked his way over the
few feet of quicksand to the hard ground of the
stream-bed. Each step was a struggle. The feeling
of the firm earth under his feet instead of that
sickening ooze was such a relief that it was all he
could do to keep from sitting down in the water
right where he was.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the feeling of security, a hazy thought
which had been puzzling him vaguely throughout
the struggle took definite form. “What are you
standing on, Murphy?” he called back over his
shoulder. It had been worrying him to know how
Murphy could stand beside him in that sink hole
and lift him up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know what it is,” Murphy answered
cheerfully, “but I guess it must be the soles of
some Chinaman’s feet,” he muttered to himself,
“from the depth I’ve gone down here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy had stood manfully to his job of freeing
Scott, neglecting to move his own feet for
fear he might shake Scott’s confidence once more
and he had settled to a dangerous depth in the
sullen sand. His legs were buried to his knees
and he could feel himself sinking steadily deeper.
Now Scott was free he devoted his best strength
to extricating himself. He pulled desperately
but did not seem to make any progress. What
he gained on one foot he seemed to lose on the
other. He did not want to call Scott back unless
his case was hopeless.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott, who had reached dry land and thrown
himself limply on the beach, looked back and saw
him struggling back there in the moonlight.
“What is the matter, Murphy?” he called in
alarm. “Are you fast now?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” Murphy lied courageously, “I dropped
my gun and I can’t seem to find it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy was gaining a little on the quicksand
now. Every time he changed feet he could feel
the other one rise a trifle, but it was killing work
and he wondered whether his strength would hold
out long enough for him to free himself. Two or
three times he felt as though he would have to
give it up; he was even losing interest in the
struggle and did not seem to care anything more
about it. He knew he was fast approaching the
limit of his strength, but he struggled on as in a
dream. He no longer knew what he was doing,
and he never knew till Scott told him afterwards
how he had staggered wearily across the creek
and collapsed on the dry beach.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did you find your gun?” Scott asked sleepily,
but there was no response. Completely exhausted,
they both slept soundly on the open
beach.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>In the meanwhile nothing had occurred to put
Qualley and Roberts to sleep. They had
followed the beach for only a short distance
after passing Murphy and had then turned off
into the swamp on a deer trail with which they
were familiar. Progress was slow in the darkness
of the swamp and the rough going did not
better their already ragged tempers. Each was
absorbed in his own brooding and there was no
talking with the exception of frequent angry exclamations
when some one of the party tripped
over a hidden stick or root. They were all in
an ugly mood, especially Roberts, whose disposition
was never very pleasant.</p>

<p class='c004'>The trail bore away to the northeast and
headed for the upper end of the swamp which cut
back into the forest from the beach like a big bay.
The trail soon lead them across that narrow neck
of swamp and out on to an open pine ridge which
bordered the big swamp to the east of it. At the
point where the trail struck it the ridge was two
or three miles wide, but it narrowed rapidly to
the northward and terminated three miles inland
in a very narrow neck not more than a hundred
yards wide between two very dense swamps.</p>

<p class='c004'>This was the place where they confidently expected
to catch Scott and Murphy. Roberts
looked at the narrow strip of open pine woods,
almost free from underbrush, with a grunt of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not much cover for them there,” he growled.
“A rabbit could not get across there to-night
without our seeing it. Unless they get suspicious
and go west on the beach they are ours.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course,” Qualley replied thoughtfully, “as
I said a while ago, there is a possibility that they
may go west or try to go north, but I don’t think
they will. They probably think that they can
travel as fast or faster than we can and would
take advantage of the lead they had to beat it
straight down the beach for town. They do not
know that the swamp is there and when they come
to it they will naturally try to get around the end
of it. That means about three miles down the
beach for them and about five up here if they
follow the edge of the swamp. They do not know
that this is the only way through, so why should
they try to avoid it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, let’s get ready for them. They’ll be
dropping in on us first thing we know and catch
us blabbing here. I’ll take this clump of brush on
the edge of the swamp, and Bob and Jim can hide
over there on the other side. You can go down
just beyond there in that bunch of palmetto and
if by any possibility I should miss ’em you would
be sure of them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Roberts suggested this arrangement because he
feared that Qualley, who he thought was not
known to be implicated in the crime, might be
loath to shoot these innocent men. He had no
such scruples himself and wanted a position
where he would have the best chance at them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Qualley raised no objection and they all separated
in silence to take up their assigned posts.
In about an hour, they figured, their victims
ought to be putting in an appearance if they were
coming at all. Qualley was apparently dozing
comfortably in his clump of palmetto and the two
hired men whispered cheerfully enough behind
their brush screen. To Roberts alone, burning
up as he was with a combination of hatred and
fear, the minutes seemed to drag insufferably.
He glanced nervously at his watch every few
minutes and eagerly stared at the first projection
on the edge of the swamp where he expected his
victims to appear. As the time he had estimated
for their arrival grew nearer, it was all that he
could do to keep from crawling out of his hiding
place and sneaking down to that point to see if
they might not be hiding just around the corner.</p>

<p class='c004'>More than an hour had passed and still they
did not come. Roberts became as restless as a
caged tiger. The owls had ceased their weird
concert back in the swamp and there was nothing
to break the stillness of the night save the never-absent
small noises of the night. If only the wind
would blow, or a tree drop or anything to break
that nerve-racking monotony. Roberts moved
irritably from one cramped position to another
and still the tardy hours dragged wearily by without
any change. Only the moon turned in her
course and started the shadows slanting in another
direction.</p>

<p class='c004'>And yet they had not come. A certain chill
crept into the air, a forewarning of the break of
day. It was the hour when the pulse of the world
is at the ebb, when sick men sometimes fail to
catch the flood and are stranded in the great Beyond.
No man can sit through it in the woods
at night and not feel a certain awe, close akin to
fear. Roberts felt it. All criminals are superstitious
and with the turning of that tide he felt
convinced that fate had turned against him. His
prey had escaped him and with their escape every
hour lessened the chances of his opportunity to
enjoy the benefits of his stolen wealth. The possibility
of spending the greater part of the remainder
of his life in a penitentiary, just when
he had acquired the means to enjoy himself, was
almost maddening.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first sudden streak of the southern dawn
shot out across the eastern sky and Roberts
could stand it no longer. With one last lingering
look at that long-watched point he crept from his
hiding place and sneaked cautiously back with
many a nervous glance over his shoulder to the
place where Qualley was stationed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let’s leave the boys here to watch this place
and go back to the beach,” he whispered. “Maybe
we can track them now in the daylight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, if you want to risk it,” Qualley assented,
a little reluctantly, “but they have about an equal
chance of seeing us first. If they have gone west
they have gone so far that we cannot catch them
and if they go any other way they must either
come here or go up past Mike so I do not see what
you will gain, but if you want to go I’m game.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll at least know where they did go,” Roberts
replied irritably. “Anything is better than
waiting here doing nothing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Qualley had just risen from his cozy nest and
stretched himself when he suddenly grabbed Roberts’
arm and they both dropped quickly back into
the shelter of the brush. A man could be very
distinctly seen slipping along the edge of the
swamp towards them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Roberts gave a grunt of satisfaction and pushed
over the safety on his revolver. “Let me take
him,” he hissed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right,” Qualley replied, “but let him get
closer. There will be less chance to miss, and besides
the other fellow is not in sight yet and you’ll
scare him off.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They waited breathlessly while the man came
slowly forward, slipping along from clump to
clump and apparently wholly unconscious of their
presence. Roberts was so eager to shoot that
only constant warnings from Qualley prevented
him from taking a shot even at the risk of losing
the other man. At last the figure had reached a
point almost opposite them on the edge of the
swamp. He stepped out into the open an instant
and looked about him. He was not more than
thirty yards away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Roberts raised his pistol and aimed quickly.
It was an easy shot and not much chance to miss.
Just as he fired Qualley shouted and struck up
the weapon. The suddenness of the blow knocked
the pistol out of Roberts’ hand and the bullet
whined harmlessly through the treetops.</p>

<p class='c004'>Roberts turned savagely upon Qualley with the
snarl of a wounded tiger. “Double cross me,
will you?” he gasped, snatching at his knife.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Double cross nothing,” Qualley answered
quietly. “Another instant and you would have
shot Joe.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Sure enough it was Joe bringing the rifle from
the camp as he had been ordered to do and he was
not slow in making himself known when he heard
the shot. They had both forgotten all about him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I guess that will be sufficient warning
to the other fellows,” Qualley remarked after a
satisfactory explanation had been made to Joe.
“There is not much use in hanging around here
any longer now. If they had not started west
before that they probably are making pretty good
time in that direction now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Roberts was too much chagrined to have any
reply. He pushed his revolver into his holster
with disgust and took his rifle from Joe.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is nothing to do now, I suppose,” he
grumbled, “except to go down to the beach and
see where they did go. I am at least going to
have that satisfaction before I sneak off into any
hiding place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll go with you,” Qualley agreed. “I’d like
to see where they went myself and there is the
bare possibility that they have spent the night
down there on the beach and were too far off to
hear that shot. Joe, you and the other boys watch
this pass till we get back.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There did not seem to be much need for caution
now, but they moved rather carefully and
scouted the ground pretty thoroughly before they
rounded any corners. They hardly expected to
find the boys traveling that way in the daytime,
but they were not taking any chances on meeting
them unexpectedly. When they came to the cut-off
trail they had not yet seen any tracks except
their own.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Want to take the trail or follow the edge of
the swamp?” Qualley asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let’s follow the trail,” Roberts growled. He
could feel his chances slipping away from him
and it made him surly.</p>

<p class='c004'>They traveled faster now, for there was not
much chance of meeting any one in that direction
and soon came out of the swamp on to the
beach. It was easy to read the signs on the
smooth sands of the beach and a glance showed
them two tracks going east. They searched more
carefully. There were none coming back.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Must be somewhere between here and the
neck,” Qualley said; “there is no possible way out
unless they found a boat. I never heard of any
one going through that swamp.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not a chance,” Roberts exclaimed with rising
spirits, “we’ll get ’em yet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The trail was plain enough on the open beach,
but it had them worried a little when it turned
back into the edge of the forest. It looked as
though they might have changed their minds and
decided to circle back to the west.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wonder if something scared them out?” Roberts
asked anxiously, as they searched for the
trail in the forest. The anxiety was of short
duration, for they soon picked up some tracks in
the palmetto scrub and when they had learned its
general direction they had no trouble in following
the trail.</p>

<p class='c004'>Qualley guessed the reason for the digression
into the forest pretty closely. “Thought they
would be less conspicuous in here and might lose
us for a while,” he explained. “It would have
worked all right last night and caused us considerable
delay, at least if we had been hard on their
trail as they probably thought we were. Rather
clever of them. They make it a little hard for
us yet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Roberts was not to be discouraged. He
had been down in the dumps a short time before
and could see nothing ahead of him but an uncomfortable
cell in the penitentiary or an almost
equally unpleasant life in a dismal hiding place;
now he felt sure of his prey and was in a triumphant
mood.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I would not give them much for their
chances,” he retorted grimly, and hastened his
pace on the uncertain trail. “In half an hour our
worries will be over.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And it certainly looked as though he was right,
for the palmetto scrub had given way to a stretch
of open sand and the trail lay clear before them,
leading straight to the sleeping men on the beach
less than a quarter of a mile away.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Scott awoke in the morning with the sun
shining full in his face. He had been so
dead to the world that it was hard for him
to realize where he was and how he came to be
sleeping on the open beach with the waves of the
rising tide lapping the sands within a few feet
of him. Suddenly the events of the night before
came to him and a feeling of horror crept over
him when he realized what a risk they had run
by exposing themselves in that way right in the
enemy’s country.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good thing they waited for us instead of coming
to look for us,” he thought, as he sat up to
reconnoiter. His first glance was down the beach
in the direction from which they had come. A
chill ran over him that seemed to leave him paralyzed;
he just stared. Then he rubbed his eyes
to see if he was really awake. It seemed like the
continuation of a dream which had been haunting
him for a good part of the night.</p>

<p class='c004'>There were Roberts and Qualley not over two
hundred yards away and walking rapidly straight
toward them. With the realization that was far
from a dream, that these men were only too real
and were hastening forward on his trail now
eager with the hope of getting a shot at him, Scott
came to life with a violent jerk. In two more
minutes they could not help seeing him if, indeed,
they had not discovered him already.</p>

<p class='c004'>He formed his plan instantly. There seemed
to be only one chance. Flattening himself as close
to the sand as possible to escape notice, he reached
out quickly and shook Murphy’s shoulder at the
same time warning him not to move or speak.
Murphy was a light sleeper and he was wide
awake the instant Scott touched him, wide enough
awake to take in his meaning at once. He simply
looked at Scott inquiringly without moving his
head or body at all.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They are after us, Murphy. They are on our
trail and not more than a few rods away. Our
only chance is to try to slip into the creek without
being seen and hide in the bushes over there
in the swamp. Careful now, but hurry.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy took a hasty peek at the two men and
felt for his gun. The holster was empty and his
face fell. He had pretended to Scott that he had
lost it in the quicksand, but he did not know that
he had. He had been inclined to fight when he
saw that there were only two men in the approaching
party, but now there was no chance.
He twisted sullenly about on the sand and wriggled
down the gentle incline after Scott, who was
already headed for the creek alligator fashion.
It was uncomfortable business, for they had seen
their enemies so clearly that it was hard to realize
that they had not been seen. They rather
expected to hear the crack of a rifle any minute.</p>

<p class='c004'>They slid quietly into the water and made for
the opposite shore, or rather the opposite rim of
brush, for there was no shore there. Scott swam
under water and managed to make shelter without
coming to the surface. Murphy could not do
that, but he held his breath and crawled on the
bottom as fast as he could. He had to come up
for air, but he stuck only his nose out of water
like a hunted loon, and was able to take his next
breath in the shelter of a titi bush. They hastily
selected a dense bush just beyond for a hiding
place and worked their way to it carefully. Fortunately
for them the bottom of the swamp was
sandy or a trail of muddy water might have betrayed them.
They were no farther away from
the shore than that. They submerged themselves
to their eyes and waited.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ought not to have any trouble in keeping cool
here,” Murphy whispered with his usual humor.
No matter how glum Murphy was feeling, danger
immediately brought his wit to his rescue.</p>

<p class='c004'>They could look out through the small openings
in the bush without much danger of being seen.
The men were so close that Scott could see the expression
on their faces. He could see that Roberts,
who was eagerly setting the pace a little way
ahead of his companion, was triumphant now and
sure that the fight was won. He could even see
the ugly cut on Roberts’ lip and how he longed
for the opportunity to put another one beside it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The men had reached the edge of the creek now
a little ways above, at the point where the boys
had taken to the water the night before in their
eagerness to reach those quicksands. They heard
a burst of profanity from Roberts. “Taken to
the water like a couple of foxes,” he exclaimed
angrily. His eye wandered down the bank of
the creek and was quick to catch the tracks in the
sand where the boys had slept. Roberts almost
ran in his eagerness. Qualley walked slowly and
thoughtfully, looking for other signs.</p>

<p class='c004'>Both men stared for a long time at that peculiar-looking
conglomeration of tracks with puzzled
faces. They could not understand the peculiar
trail the boys had made when they had wriggled
down into the creek a few minutes before. Scott
thanked heaven that there was no way to tell in
that dry sand how recently those marks had been
made.</p>

<p class='c004'>Qualley squatted down and examined every detail
carefully. “That is evidently where they
slept,” he said, pointing to the impressions of the
outstretched figures. “I think I know what they
did. They went over there and tackled that
quicksand and got stuck. They managed to get
out of it and came over here on the beach to rest
up and decide what they were going to do next.
But blessed if I can figure out what they were
doing there,” and he pointed to the peculiar slides.
He arose suddenly and looked out toward the
cape. “Don’t suppose they could have built a
raft and made the cape, do you?” he asked, as
though questioning himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No signs of their having built one here,”
Roberts replied, “but it looks as though they had
pulled something into the water. Might have
been an old plank, but that would have been
water-logged and would not float.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Qualley turned thoughtfully from the cape and
fixed his gaze absent-mindedly on the very bunch
of brush behind which the boys were hiding. It
seemed to them that he must see them and they
both involuntarily sank a little deeper into the
water. Between the excitement and the chill of
the swamp water their teeth were chattering so
that they were afraid it would be heard clear
across the creek.</p>

<p class='c004'>Qualley shook his head slowly. “No, there is
only one thing that they could have done; they
must have tried to cross the swamp. We can see
plain enough that they were here and there are no
tracks leading away from here. They did not
build a raft and Murphy can’t swim, so there is
nothing left but the swamp. Well, I wish them
joy of their trip.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Roberts hated to give in. “There is not much
chance of their getting across, but I wish we knew
what had happened to them so that we would not
be in suspense so long. It will be a week before
we can be sure that they did not get away. Possibly
they got foxy and followed up the edge of
the creek a ways to shake us off the trail.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We can soon find that out,” Qualley replied;
“we can follow the edge of the swamp up to where
the others are waiting and see whether we can
pick up any tracks. They could not have passed
us that way in the night or we would have heard
them. Nothing could move through that brush
without making an awful racket, especially at
night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If we don’t find anything,” Roberts grumbled,
“I suppose it will be up to us to beat it for
that cursed cabin and wait to see what happens.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” Qualley said indifferently, “it would
not be safe to put it off much longer. I’ll keep a
watch out for them around here for a while longer
to make sure that they do not come back out of
the swamp and then go back to the camp and
wait to see if they get back there. If they show
up I’ll let you know at once. If they have not
come through by the end of a week it will probably
be safe to get back to work again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When Qualley said that he would watch a while
to see that they did not come back the boys’ hearts
sank, for they knew that they could not hold out
in that cold water much longer, and, as Qualley
had said, no one could move in that swamp without
making a racket which could easily be heard
by any one listening on the other side of the
creek. They looked at each other with a sigh of
relief when the two men turned and walked off
up the edge of the creek together.</p>

<p class='c004'>They waited breathlessly till they saw the men
round a point some distance away with their eyes
on the ground watching for any telltale signs.
“Well, now what shall we do?” Murphy whispered
between his chattering teeth.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve got to get out of here and get warm before
I can even think,” Scott replied. His lips were
blue and he was shivering so that he could hardly
talk. “I wonder if we could not find a log or
something over there on that quicksand where
we could get in the sun without being in plain
sight of any one who came along?”</p>

<p class='c004'>They waded over toward the quicksand, feeling
their way cautiously and expecting every
minute to feel the sand giving way beneath them.
A large tree which had fallen with its stump on
the solid ground and its top buried in the quicksand
offered them just the kind of place they
wanted. They crawled quickly on to the fallen
trunk and then eagerly out into the sunlight.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gee! doesn’t that sun feel fine?” Murphy
chattered. “I wish we dared to build a fire. I
don’t feel as though I could ever get warm clear
through again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Of course they did not dare to build a fire and
were obliged to content themselves with sitting in
the sunlight and beating themselves with their
arms to try to stimulate their tardy circulations.
It was about a quarter of an hour before their
teeth ceased to chatter and they began to feel at
all comfortable.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now then,” Scott said, basking flat on the log
so that he could soak up as much warmth as possible,
“which shall it be? Wait here till dark and
then try to run the gauntlet up around that neck
they have been watching, make a break now to the
west and take a chance on getting away before
Qualley comes back, or have a try at crossing this
swamp?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy threw a disgusted look at the cold
swamp in which he had been soaking for the
last half-hour and showed very clearly that no
matter what he might think of any of the other
schemes he would prefer anything to any more
wading. “Gosh!” he exclaimed suddenly with so
much feeling that Scott straightened up to see
what had happened, “I’d sure hate to be an alligator.
Don’t like that plan of going up around
that neck much better either. No telling how
long they might leave a guard hanging around up
there. I’m for a break to the west. There would
not be so much uncertainty about that. We’d
either make it, or we wouldn’t,” he added with a
shrug.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Might try Qualley’s raft scheme,” Scott suggested.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing doing!” Murphy exclaimed emphatically.
“That would be worse than trying the
neck. It would take us hours to float across there
and Qualley might come back and practice some
long-distance target shooting on us for an hour
or so. Even if he missed us he could go around
to the head of the cape and catch us when we
came out. No, that does not appeal to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>As a matter of fact it did not appeal to Scott
either. Like Murphy he was in favor of staking
everything on a dash to the west. If Qualley did
not happen to see them right at the start they
would be comparatively safe for the rest of the
way. He had wanted to try the swamp till he
had found how cold the water could get, now he
felt that he would very much prefer being shot.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right, then,” he agreed, “let’s make a
break for it. We ought to hunt up a log like this
or something of the sort where we could get out
of here without leaving a trail right on the edge
of it, and we better work our way up to that point
so that we can see that no one is right on hand to
see us start.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Now that they had decided what to do it
seemed as though it was already half done, and
they began to feel a great deal more hopeful.
They almost forgot that they had been half
frozen a little while before, but the thought of
wading ashore now reminded them of it. How
they hated to get off that log into the cold
water.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are we ready?” Scott asked, preparing to
slide from the log.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure,” Murphy replied cheerfully. “I’d feel a
little more like it if I had something to eat, but I
guess I can make it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They slid quietly off the log into the water
and made their way cautiously back toward the
creek, keeping a sharp lookout for any one who
might have come back to have a last look for
them. There was no one in sight on the beach.
Keeping just inside the brush on the edge of the
swamp, they worked their way up to the point
where Qualley and Roberts had disappeared a
while before. They could see for quite a distance
here and the coast seemed clear.</p>

<p class='c004'>They could not find any log which would take
them out of the creek on the opposite side and
clear of the bank, but they selected a large clump
of bunch grass for a landing place, took one more
look to make sure that no one was watching, and
made a dash for it. It seemed to Scott that he
had been putting in most of his time lately tearing
around the country with the expectation of
being shot in the back. They half expected it
now. Scott stepped on a stick which broke with
a loud crack and Murphy jumped three feet in
the air.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Begorra, I thought they had me that time!”
he grumbled as he ran the faster. “I wonder if
it would really feel as mean to be shot in the back
as a fellow thinks it would?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shut up,” Scott growled. “Think of something
pleasant to say, can’t you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>They had not realized how thin that pine woods
was till they tried to hide themselves in it. It
seemed as though you could see through it for
half a mile. They had run all of that before they
felt at all safe and sat down on a log to catch
their breath.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we have passed the worst of it,” Scott
panted, “but I’ll feel a lot better when we have
crossed that railroad and gotten into a country
where we are not likely to run into any one who
will be looking for us. It would be just our luck
to meet some one on that railroad track.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They were anxious to have the suspense over
and soon started again, traveling in the edge of
the woods where they could keep an eye on the
beach. They crossed the trail the men had taken
the night before and were soon in sight of the
track. They reconnoitered before they ventured
into the open, but the place seemed completely deserted.
The schooner was gone and the bay was
empty. They listened a long time, but could hear
nothing save the monotonous lapping of the water
on the beach.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Guess it’s all right,” Murphy remarked, walking
out into the open. He made his way straight
for the old camp fire and began hunting around
it as though he had lost something the night before.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What did you lose?” Scott asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing, I was only hoping that they had lost
something to eat here. If I had that deer we saw
last night I could chew a leg off her. When did
we have anything to eat last, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a long time since they had had any food
and the sight of the empty tin cans around the
fire made it seem even longer. They could not
find so much as a scrap of bread.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Cheer up, Murphy,” Scott exclaimed, “we are
going into a new country now and we may find a
house in the first fifty miles or so. Who knows?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>They were, indeed, going into a new
country, that is, a new and strange country
to them, but really a very cold country
if they were to believe the signs about them. They
were scarcely out of sight of the camp-fire site
when they stumbled on to the ruins of the old
town of St. Joseph. It had evidently been a gay
and prosperous place at one time. The outlines
of the foundations of huge cotton warehouses
were distinctly traceable and the ground was littered
with pieces of broken bricks. A little
farther on they found a foundation almost half
full of broken champagne bottles, and beyond
that the oval of a racetrack almost uncanny in its
appearance of recent use. There were certain
things about it which made it seem as though the
place had been suddenly destroyed by an earthquake
or other catastrophe only a short time before.
It was very hard to realize that there had
been no one living there for eighty years.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a question with the boys whether they
would push on west along the beach in the hope
of striking a town in that direction or whether
they would turn north to the main-line railroad.
Their experience with the blind pocket which
they had gotten into the night before made them
a little afraid of the beach, and they had no idea
how far it might be in that direction before they
would come to a town. They knew that the railroad
could not be over forty miles north and
thought it would be reasonable to expect to find
some settlement in that direction. Food was beginning
to be a serious consideration.</p>

<p class='c004'>They stood on the edge of the old town and
looked about them. Each knew what was in the
other’s mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let’s try it to the north,” Murphy suggested.
“There ought to be some grub somewhere up in
that direction.”</p>

<p class='c004'>That agreed pretty well with Scott’s decisions
and they turned toward the north. The country
was about as forlorn-looking as any that Scott
had ever seen. The big timber had been cut away
for some miles, probably to supply the old town,
and there was nothing left but a scattering stand
of scrub oak on the flat, white sand, with now and
then a small patch of scrub palmetto. Aside from
the old and blackened stumps there was not a
trace of the civilization which had at one time
flourished so near there. They had been traveling
through this dismal waste for about an hour.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t look much like anything to eat around
here!” Scott exclaimed in disgust.</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy did not reply. He was too hungry for
words, but after about a half-hour’s silence he
answered:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wonder why a fellow has to think about
something he can’t get all the time. I try to think
about something as far away from food as I can
and in two minutes I’m longing for a beefsteak
again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott had been trying the same thing and knew
that it was true. But they both felt that their
strength would hold out for the day all right
and they would surely find some habitation before
the end of the day. The sand was not soft
enough to bother them and they were making
good time. At least they did not have to worry
about the men who were looking for them over
there to the east.</p>

<p class='c004'>They must have covered about six miles in this
way when the same old curse of this country
loomed up in front of them in the form of a
swamp which stretched as far as they could see
to east and west. They both sighted it at about
the same time and looked at each other in utter
disgust.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am for going straight through her,” Scott
exclaimed determinedly, “if she is ten miles wide
and a mile deep. If you follow the edge of it
west it will probably lead to a quicksand on the
beach, and if you follow it east you will end up
on that same neck where those fellows are waiting
for us. This country seems to have been built
for their special benefit,” he added bitterly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m with you,” Murphy agreed doggedly.
“I’d rather drown than be starved to death.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So they held to their course and traveled
straight toward the great black swamp. It might
have looked like courage to an onlooker, but they
themselves knew that it was desperation. If it
happened to be a narrow one they would get
through all right; if it was a wide one, well—they
probably could not do much better by trying to
get around.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were not more than a hundred yards
from the swamp when Scott stopped with an exclamation
of surprise. They had come upon a
distinct trail angling across their course. There
were no footprints in it now, but it was a broad
trail such as people make, and showed evidence
of having been considerably used at no very distant
date.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you suppose that is?” Scott asked
wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy looked at it with little interest. He
could not eat it and he no longer had any interest
in anything unless it gave promise of dinner.
“Leads down to that logging camp unless my
geography is crooked and we might as well follow
it to the swamp. It’s going our way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe it goes through the swamp,” Scott suggested
with a flash of hope. “Wonder where
those fellows did get their supplies from? I
should think they would have been afraid to get
them from the river boats. It would have made
their place too conspicuous.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They followed the trail with curiosity even if
without much hope and saw it duck into the heavy
brush. As he ducked in after it Scott uttered a
shout of triumph. There was a boat chained to
a tree at the end of the trail. Like the trail it
was far from new but showed signs of use at a
comparatively recent date.</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy’s spirits came up with a bound.
“Well,” he exclaimed, “this is the first piece of
real luck we have had in some time. That boat
looks almost as good to me as a loaf of bread.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The question of ownership never entered their
heads. They had been in dire need of a boat and
Providence had provided one. There were no
questions asked. There were no oars, but Murphy
cut a pole with his hunting knife and they
were soon skimming over the water merrily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Set your course due north, boy, and point it
out to me, that’s all I ask!” he exclaimed, as he
heaved away on the pole. “That swamp water
does not look so bad from a boat, does it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>They had gone with one bound from the dumps
of despair to the summit of hope and they were
so happy they felt silly. They had not realized
how worried they really were. Now nothing
seemed impossible. They felt perfectly confident
that all their troubles were over and they would
soon be at headquarters reporting their great discovery.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were well out in the swamp, probably a
half mile or more when Murphy gave a shout and
redoubled his efforts with the pole. Scott thought
he had sighted dry land again and stood up in the
boat to see. Instead of land it was a house built
up on piles in the middle of the swamp.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Surely no one lives in that house away out
there!” Scott exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Probably not,” Murphy replied cheerfully;
“but there may be something to eat in it just the
same.” And he headed for the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no smoke coming out of the chimney
and nothing to show that it was occupied or
had been for some time. The porch in front of
it was really a landing with steps coming down
to the water. They shouted but there was no answer.
Scott thought they were wasting time in
stopping there at all, but Murphy was determined
to see if there was anything there to eat. He
declared that he would never forgive himself if
he passed it up now and found out later that there
was food in it.</p>

<p class='c004'>They tied the boat to the steps and went to the
door. Murphy pushed it open gently and looked
in. It was rather dark inside and it was a few
minutes before their eyes became accustomed to
the half light. Then things loomed up plainly and
Murphy uttered a shout of satisfaction. The
shelves all along one corner of the building were
piled with provisions of all kinds. A number of
bunks were built against the wall at the other
end of the building, but they paid very little attention
to that except to glance at them to make sure
there was no one there. Their interest was centered
in those shelves.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Whew!” Murphy whistled as he gloated over
the great store of provisions, “wouldn’t we have
been sore if we had passed this up? I don’t know
who lives here, but I am going to have one full
meal on him whoever he is. Gee! he has enough
stuff here to stand a siege of six months.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Strange!” Scott pondered as he looked over
the supplies. “It does not look as though any one
had lived here for several months at least and yet
these provisions are all fresh and could not have
been here such a great while. This looks like an
old house on the outside but from the looks of
the floors I don’t believe it has ever been lived in
much. I don’t understand it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am not going to try to understand it till I
have had my fill of this bacon and flapjacks.
What do you want, tea or coffee? He, whoever
he is, has them both here.” Murphy did not seem
to care whether the provisions belonged to man or
devil, and felt that the mystery could wait for a
solution till he had satisfied his appetite.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott built a fire in the stove for Murphy and
then returned to look things over some more.
Suddenly he uttered an exclamation of such profound
astonishment that even Murphy paused in
his cooking to see what had happened. Scott had
found a sales slip wrapped up with one of the
bundles and the groceries listed on it were
charged to Mr. Roberts.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By cracky!” Scott exclaimed, looking at Murphy
with eyes round with surprise, “I have it.
This is the very cabin where those fellows are
coming to hide. They keep it stocked up for just
such an emergency.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The fact that they had walked into the very
den of the scoundrels who had been out gunning
for them all the night before and were probably
even then on their way there startled them a little
at first. But nothing could divert Murphy’s attention
from his frying pan for very long.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, well,” he said philosophically, “we have
their boat, so they are not likely to get here before
we have finished dinner. Nothing could stop
me from eating now; it would take more than that
outfit to spoil my appetite.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A little chuckle of satisfaction died on Scott’s
lips. It would be a good joke on the thieves to
find their boat gone just when they needed it, but
where would they go if they could not get to the
hiding place they had prepared? They might get
suspicious and go somewhere else where no trace
could be found of them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wonder if they have another boat anywhere?”
he exclaimed. “I wish we had not taken
this one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t worry,” Murphy replied as he chewed a
piece of half-cooked bacon, “I don’t think they
would be likely to abandon a place which they
have prepared and fixed up the way they have this
one. At least they would not give it up so easily.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No use in worrying about it now, anyway.
We can’t take the boat back without running too
much risk and any damage we have done cannot
be helped. We’ll eat all of their grub we can and
then beat it on across the swamp. We will get
Qualley when he comes back to the camp and I
have a sneaking idea that it would not take much
to make him tell on the other fellows.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Any one of them would hang all the others
for a plugged nickel,” Murphy growled contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c004'>So they made the best of their opportunities
and gave no further thought to the future trouble
they might be piling up for themselves. There
was unlimited food and for a long time there
seemed to be no end to their appetites, but they
were satisfied at last and stretched out on a
couple of the benches in supreme contentment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gee!” Murphy exclaimed, “I’m full right up
to my Adam’s apple and I’d like to stay right here
and sleep for a week.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But instead of sleeping they both sat suddenly
bolt upright and stared wide-eyed at each other.
The sound of voices came to them very distinctly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>For at least a minute neither of the boys
spoke. They knew that Roberts and his
gang had planned on coming there to the
cabin that morning, but it had not occurred to
them that they could be there so soon. Moreover,
they had rather taken it for granted that
they had possession of the only boat in the swamp.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott realized now that he had been grossly
careless. There was no possible justification for
their staying in that cabin after they learned
whose it was and knew that the others were planning
on coming there. He was filled with remorse
now and would have given anything to be
out of the scrape, but it was too late. They were
trapped like a couple of rats and the ferrets were
rapidly approaching the only possible way out.
Scott fairly groaned. Possibly they would not
get out and no news would ever reach the outside
world as to what had become of them, but if the
truth should ever become known it was maddening
to think that they would be reported as having
lost out on a most important mission through
carelessness and a few hours of hunger.</p>

<p class='c004'>But trapped and hopelessly outnumbered as
they knew themselves to be they had no idea of
giving up without a struggle. Scott slipped noiselessly
from the bench and grabbed an iron bar
which was leaning against the door frame and
was evidently intended to bar the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Get that ax-handle over there in the corner,”
he whispered to Murphy, “and take your place on
the other side of the door. We’ll get as many of
them as we can. I’ll take the first one who comes
in the door and you take the next.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They took up their stations and waited grimly
with nerves on edge. They expected every instant
to hear the boat bump the landing and the
thud of feet on the steps. But they did not come.
The suspense was terrific. Suddenly Scott remembered
their boat tied to the landing. No
wonder they did not land. They knew that there
were strangers within and probably suspected
who it was. They were probably holding a council
of war now to determine the best method of
attack, for they would not know that the boys
had lost their guns in the quicksands.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott felt that he must know what was going on
at all hazards and he slipped cautiously over to
the window in the front of the cabin and peeped
out. At first he could see nothing and thought
they must have gone around to the other side,
but just as he was turning away a moving object
quite a distance off in the swamp caught his eye.
It was two darkies in a bateau paddling straight
away from the cabin. He heaved a sigh of relief.
For the moment they were saved. The next
instant he realized what it meant and groaned
inwardly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There goes the news!” he exclaimed bitterly,
as he pointed out the rapidly disappearing boat
to Murphy. “It may be a long chase now before
we ever locate those fellows again, if we ever find
them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, we’ll find them all right when the time
comes,” Murphy replied cheerfully. “The thing
to do now is to get out of this trap as fast as we
know how before any one else comes. If we can
get away I’m not worrying about the rest of it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott realized the wisdom of the suggestion,
but he thought it best to cover up their tracks as
best they could. They quickly straightened up
the cabin, put everything as nearly as they could
just as they had found it, took one cautious glance
around the swamp and hurried out to their boat.
They half expected to hear a shot from the back
of the cabin. There was no window on that side
of the house and they had no assurance that there
had not been two bateaux, one of which might be
lying in wait for them. But there was no sound
and a hurried survey discovered no boat in sight.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now for it!” Murphy exclaimed, bending to
his pole with all his might. “I wouldn’t stop to
eat anywhere else before I get to headquarters if
I was starving.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They did not realize how badly they had been
scared in that cabin till they found how hard they
were working to get away from it. They were
headed due north by the compass and going as
fast as they could. Scott had caught up a fishing
pole off the landing and was doing his best to
help. It was not till they were far out of sight of
the cabin that they relaxed a little in their efforts.
They were at least a mile from the south edge of
the swamp and still there was no intimation that
they were approaching the other side.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good thing we found this boat,” Murphy commented;
“we’d have drowned before this if we had
tried to cross this place without it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott did not reply. He was wondering how
far it was from the north edge of the swamp to
the railroad track and how long it would be before
they could get a train going in their direction.
When he had discovered the log canal and
the hidden mill he had thought his work in Florida
was about completed, and successfully completed.
The scare at the cabin had showed him how easy
it would be for him to fail completely even yet.
He was anxious now to get back to headquarters
and place his information where it would be safe.</p>

<p class='c004'>They had covered at least another mile and
were beginning to think that the swamp must extend
clear up into Georgia when they began to
see some signs of land ahead. They were coming
to a fringe of dense underbrush and behind it
they could see the tops of pine trees. In a few
minutes they were standing on solid ground once
more with an open pine forest stretching away
to the northward as far as they could see.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, it can’t be more than a hundred miles
from here to the railroad!” Murphy exclaimed.
“Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They were both anxious to get out of that unknown
country where so many unexpected things
seemed to happen to them, and set out at a lively
pace. The country continued to be dry and open,
but it was at least two hours before they saw any
sign of life or a road or anything else which would
indicate that they were anywhere near civilization.
Then they sighted a little cabin far ahead
of them in the woods. Smoke was curling from
the chimney and two men were leaning on the
front fence with their backs toward them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott decided that there could be no danger in
approaching these people who could not possibly
know anything about them and he wanted to learn
the shortest way to the railroad. They advanced
in silence and their feet made no sound in the
soft sand. The men in the yard turned out to be
a couple of darkies and they seemed to be enjoying
some huge joke. Their laughter broke out
in an almost continuous high-pitched cackle and
they were having altogether too good a time to
pay any attention to the approach of strangers.
In fact, strangers were so rare in that section that
no one ever thought of seeing one. The boys
were not very far from the cabin when one of
the darkies roared between his gusts of laughter,
“No, suh, you won’t ketch me tryin’ to steal no
grub out of dat cabin ag’in. A little mo’ and we’d
a-walked right in on ’em and you know what Mist’
Roberts said de las’ time he ketched us out dere.
No, suh, I’ll buy my grub fust.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott stopped in astonishment and stared at
Murphy. So that was what had scared them so
at the cabin; only a couple of darkies trying to
steal some of the supplies. And Roberts had not
learned anything of their whereabouts, nor was
he likely to from these fellows. It was the first
cheerful news he had had for some time.</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy cleared his throat loudly and the two
darkies jumped almost out of their skins and
looked as though they were about to run away.
The sight of the two forest service uniforms did
not seem to reassure them. The weight of a
guilty conscience made them nervous.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Say, boy,” Murphy called to reassure them,
for he was familiar enough with darkies to know
that if they were frightened there would be no
hope of getting the truth out of them about anything,
“which is the nearest road to the railroad
station?”</p>

<p class='c004'>It took the darky a moment to recover from his
fright, but the terror died from his face when he
realized that the stranger had not said anything
about robbing a cabin and he grinned respectfully.
“Dat de road right deah, boss, de ain’t no
otheh.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How far is it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fo’ miles, suh. Leastways dat’s what dey calls
it around heah.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy wanted to ask what station it was but
he did not want to acknowledge that he was as
completely lost as all that. So they took the little
used track in the sand which the darky had dignified
by the name of a road and walked on as
though they were perfectly satisfied and knew
just where they were going. There was one
thing they did know. They knew that they had
furnished the darkies with a subject of conversation
which would keep them busy for some time
to come.</p>

<p class='c004'>Like most estimates of distance in the country
the “fo’ miles” proved to be rather a rough
guess and it was pretty well along in the afternoon
when they came in sight of the three or
four houses which composed the railroad town.
The few people who were in sight eyed them curiously
when they walked into the station. They
were too far from the forest for any one to recognize
their service uniforms and every one took
them for soldiers.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no train till ten o’clock that night.
It seemed as though they had eaten enough of
Roberts’ supplies out there in the swamp to last
them for a week, but they were hungry again already
and walked over to the store to get some
crackers and cheese for supper. The storekeeper
asked them so many questions that they had a
hard time eating their lunch after they had bought
it, but it at least gave Scott a chance to ask a few
questions in return.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Isn’t there a Mr. Roberts living somewhere
around here?” he asked casually.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He don’t exactly live around heah, suh, but
he does his buyin’ heah. He operates a sawmill
down to the south of heah. Fine gentleman,
suh.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott reserved his opinion about the qualities of
the gentleman in question, but Murphy could not
suppress a very audible snort of contempt. They
picked up what little information they could
about the sawmill, which was not much, and
strolled outside to wait for the train. They felt
fairly safe here, but they would feel safer outside
where it was dark.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Scott and Murphy walked out to a little
grove of pines a short distance from the
station and sat down in the shadow to wait
for the train. They did not talk much, for each
one was too busy thinking over the scrapes they
had been through. They felt that they were
through with their troubles at last and that it
was only a matter of a few hours now till they
would be back at headquarters, on familiar
ground and safe from interference, but they had
felt that same way so often before that they were
almost afraid to say anything about it now.</p>

<p class='c004'>Their appearance had caused a great deal of
speculation and gossip among the loafers around
the place and many curious glances were thrown
in their direction, but no one came near them.
The train was late as usual, but it came at last
and they climbed aboard with a certain feeling of
relief. There might be a wreck but there would
not be any quicksands or swamps and a wreck
seemed rather trivial compared with those two
things which they had come to hate so cordially
in the past few days.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we are on the home stretch now,” Scott
exclaimed comfortably.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” Murphy retorted, “for the first time in
what seems like a century we know where we are
going and how we are going to get there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The train stopped at the first station. There
did not seem to be much of an excuse for a station
there, nor anywhere else along the line for that
matter, but the train always stopped at all of them
as if it hoped that sometime there might be somebody
there. This time it was not disappointed.
Scott was looking out of the window and he saw
a lone man step across the platform and get on
the front end of the car. No one else was in
sight there, not even a station agent.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before he had drawn in his head he felt Murphy
grab him suddenly by the knee and squeeze
it meaningly. He looked inquiringly at Murphy
and then followed his glance up the car. The new
passenger was walking slowly toward them and
he instantly recognized Qualley. The car lamps
evidently dazzled Qualley’s eyes after his wait in
the darkness and he had not seen them, but just as
he was turning into a seat he stopped for a glance
over the occupants of the car and recognized
them. With well-feigned surprise he changed his
mind about the seat and came towards them,
smiling.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Blamed old fox!” Murphy growled under his
breath. “If he knew what we know he would
have kept off this train.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” Qualley exclaimed good-humoredly,
shaking hands with them, “I didn’t expect to see
any one I knew on this train. Glad to see you.
Good ways from home, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Quite a jump,” Scott replied. “We’ve been
out having a look at the country. Quite a journey
for you, too, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, first time I have been out of camp for a
long time. Company wanted me to come down
here and look over some turpentine prospects.
They are thinking of leasing in here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Aren’t you afraid they will take advantage of
your absence to steal all the logs in the pond?”
Scott asked, and he nudged Murphy secretly with
his foot.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You bet I was,” Qualley replied with a hearty
laugh, “and I told the boys not to put any in there
while I was gone. Haven’t run on to any likely
clues yet, have you?” he added.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, nothing new since we saw you last,” and
Scott nudged Murphy again. They were having
a very good time with Qualley.</p>

<p class='c004'>As they approached their own station Murphy
seemed to grow thoughtful. Suddenly he leaned
forward and unbuttoned the flap of Qualley’s
holster. “What sort of a gun have you got there,
Qualley? I lost my old Luger back there in a
swamp. Had it for ten years and would not have
lost it for a farm.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy drew the revolver from the holster
and examined it critically. It was a little blue
steel automatic .32, very neat and very business-like.
“Not quite such a hard hitter as mine,”
Murphy commented, “but I guess she’d kill a man
at that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Would it!” Qualley laughed. “Well, I rather
think it would if you hit him right. I killed a
deer with it at forty yards last fall.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy continued to toy with the gun. He
unloaded it, loaded it, and tested the mechanism
several times, tried the grip in his hand and aimed
it carefully at all the lights in the car. It was
not till the train was coming to a stop at their
own station that he leaned over and slipped it
back into Qualley’s holster.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Looks pretty good to me,” Murphy remarked,
as though thoroughly satisfied with his examination.
“Maybe I’ll get one of those next time. It
would not be as heavy to tote around as the old
Luger and I reckon it would shoot hard enough
for anything I want it for. Don’t want to sell it,
do you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not for anything you would give me for it,”
Qualley replied. “I need it in my business almost
every day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s right,” Murphy admitted thoughtfully,
“I reckon you do, all right,” and he stepped on
Scott’s foot.</p>

<p class='c004'>They all three got off the car together and
started down the trail which lead by a short cut
to the supervisor’s headquarters. It was about
midnight and there was no one in sight around
the station, not even the agent. The moon was
doing its best to shine through a thin curtain of
clouds and the trail was easy enough to follow.
They walked three abreast through the open
country and were soon back on the one subject
of conversation which had been the common topic
with them now for over two years—the marvelous
disappearance of those logs.</p>

<p class='c004'>About a mile from the station the trail crossed
a rather wide neck of shallow swamp. In a rainy
year it would have been impassable, but it was
almost dry now and made very good walking. It
suddenly occurred to Scott that Qualley was not
going in the direction of his camp. “Doesn’t this
trail take you a good way out of your road?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“About a mile, but this is the only place where
there is a trail across the swamp and I have never
had the energy to cut another.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When the trail entered the swamp it narrowed
so that they were obliged to go in single file.
Murphy stopped to let Qualley go first, but he
politely held back and insisted on them leading
the way. Murphy smiled a little to himself,
shoved Scott gently into the lead and followed
with Qualley bringing up the rear. Conversation
was not so easy now and they walked in comparative
silence. The ground was so soft and spongy
that their feet made very little noise and every
little sound was easily heard. It was so dark in
the swamp that only the outline of things could
be seen.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were about in the middle of the swamp
when Murphy heard a faint sound for which he
had been listening intently ever since they had
strung out on the narrow trail. It was a gentle
slap caused by the falling of a leather flap. He
listened now even more intently and was almost
immediately rewarded by a sharp click close behind
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What was that?” he exclaimed, whirling
about.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott stopped and turned around to see what
was going on and was just in time to see Murphy
strike Qualley a crashing blow on the jaw before
he even had a chance to answer the question.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah, ha, you old fox!” Murphy exclaimed, as
he leaned over the fallen man, “I was a little too
smart for you that time. That’s a fine gun you
have, but it is not much good without cartridges.
Just wait till I load her up and then she will work
better.” He picked the gun up from the soft
ground where Qualley had dropped it, and taking
a clip of cartridges from his pocket he calmly
proceeded to load it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the trouble?” Scott asked. The whole
thing had occurred so suddenly that he had not
been able to comprehend it. He had been busy
planning out the best method of attacking that
cabin.</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy explained it as coolly as though nothing
had happened.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It occurred to me back there in the train that
it might not be altogether safe to be in the woods
with this fellow alone at night when he knew
where we were, so I unloaded his gun. When
he came down this way with us to cross the
swamp I knew that there was something up, for
it would have been nearer for him to have walked
up the railroad track a way and then cut across.
Didn’t you notice how polite I was when I tried
to persuade him to walk ahead of me through
this swamp? Never knew me to be that polite
before, did you? And when he turned out to be
more polite than I was, I knew just exactly what
to expect. I heard the flap of his holster flip
down when he drew his gun and I heard her click
when he pulled the trigger. I was afraid he
might run away and reload so I dropped him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott shuddered. He realized how closely he
had rubbed shoulders with cold-blooded murder
and how easily it could have been carried out if
it had not been for Murphy’s forethought.
“Must have taken some nerve to let him pull that
trigger when you knew just what he was doing.
Weren’t you afraid that he might have reloaded?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Believe me, I’ve been watching him ever since
we got off the train. I knew that he could not
reload without my hearing him and I sure listened.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Qualley groaned and looked about him uncertainly
like a man awakening from a dream and
trying to get his wits together. Suddenly it came
to him and he sat up with a jerk.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This what you are looking for?” Murphy
asked mockingly, as he poked the muzzle of the
gun into his face. “Don’t monkey with it, it’s
loaded now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Qualley realized instantly that he had been
outwitted. He could not for the life of him think
how they had been lead to suspect him and he
was a little bit dazed by the unexpected blow, but
his magnificent nerve was unshaken. He looked
quietly into the muzzle of the gun with unmoved
expression.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pretty clever,” he exclaimed admiringly, “but
what is the big idea? You swipe the loads out of
my gun, and then when I try to shoot an alligator
you whirl around and knock me down without
warning. If it is supposed to be a joke you are
carrying it a little too far.” He was a splendid
actor and if Scott had not had such good evidence
of his intentions he would have doubted himself
rather than this indignant Qualley.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s a good bluff, Qualley,” Murphy jeered,
“but it won’t work. You can sue me for assault
if you want to when you get out of the pen, but it
is too late to sit here in the swamp and argue
about it to-night. Get up from there and trot
along with us. It’s nearer to headquarters than
it is to your camp and I know Mr. Graham will
be glad to put you up there over night. We’ll
tell Roberts that we reached camp all right so
you need not worry about his thinking that you
have gone back on him. Come ahead. It was
mighty polite of you to let me go first back there,
but this time I am going to show the politeness.
After you, Gaston. Better take the rear, Scott,
I don’t want to take a chance on plugging you if
he should make a break for it. Now we’re right.
Let’s travel.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Qualley knew that it was hopeless to try to bluff
them now and he took the lead without another
word. The little procession was more silent now
than it had been before and the grin on Murphy’s
face was wider.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>It was about one o’clock in the morning when
they finally reached headquarters. Hardly
a word had been spoken since the argument
in the swamp. Scott opened the door and struck
a light while Murphy guarded the prisoner.
Scarcely was the lamp lighted than Mr. Graham
appeared in the doorway in his pajamas.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, by George!” he exclaimed, as he grasped
Scott’s hand, “here you are at last. I have
scoured the woods from Dan to Beersheba and
was just about to order out a searching party to-morrow.
Where under the sun have you been?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Scouring the woods same as you have,” Scott
laughed, “but I guess Murphy can tell you better
where we have been than I can. I did not know
where we were most of the time. Come on in,
Murphy, and bring your friend with you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The screen door opened and Qualley walked in
closely followed by Murphy. He may have been
very much humiliated, but it did not show in his
face. He seemed to be the coolest one in the
bunch.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, hello, Qualley!” Mr. Graham exclaimed
cordially. “I did not know that you were with
the boys. Mrs. Murphy told me that you had
gone with Burton,” he continued, shaking Murphy
by the hand, “but she did not say anything
about Qualley.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Guess she did not know about him,” Scott
grinned, “he joined us later.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, let’s hear about it. Did you find any
clue?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“This one,” Scott answered, motioning toward
Qualley; and at the same time Mr. Graham noticed
the pistol in Murphy’s hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What!” he cried in astonishment, “do you
mean to say that this man is connected with the
robbery?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Funny, isn’t it?” Murphy remarked. “First
time I ever heard of a fellow robbing himself, informing
on himself, and then helping to catch
himself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Graham was too much astonished to say a
word. He simply stared at Qualley
open-mouthed. At last he recovered sufficiently to
repeat his request to Scott to tell him about it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott told the whole story of the long search
through the swamp, the trip to the mill, the disappearance
of the logs from the raft, the discovery
of the canal, the elaborate plan that had been
developed to manufacture the logs and dispose
of the lumber, and all the wild adventures they
had after they met the strangers at old St.
Joseph’s.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Graham listened quietly, commenting or
asking a question now and then when some point
was not quite clear. He had heard of the mill
which was shipping from the old port at St.
Joseph’s but he had never dreamed of connecting
it in any way with the disappearance of the logs
from his own forest. He seemed rather amused
and very much elated over the whole thing till
Scott described Qualley’s attempt to murder them
in the swamp on the way over from the station.
Then his face suddenly hardened and he glared
at Qualley with anything but a pleasant expression.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So you would be a murderer as well as a
thief,” he exclaimed contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c004'>Qualley did not seem to be in the least abashed.
“Now let me explain a few things to you, Mr.
Graham, before you get a wrong impression of
this thing. The story which these boys tell
sounds reasonable enough and I have no doubt
they think it is true, but they are altogether mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy gave a contemptuous grunt and Scott
looked his indignation, but Qualley ignored them
completely.</p>

<p class='c004'>“First, in regard to this ridiculous story of my
attempting to murder them. I might rather say
that they attempted to murder me. I happened
to remember that Murphy had been examining
my revolver on the train; I had seen him load it
and unload it once or twice and I thought that I
better make sure that it was in working order. I
took it out to examine it and just then Murphy
whirled around and knocked me down without the
slightest warning. When I came to he had my
gun and made me come along here with him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure I whirled and knocked ye down,” Murphy
commented with an air of comfortable satisfaction.
“I’d been listening for that same little
click ever since I heard you talking over your
murderous plans down there on the beach.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“For that I don’t blame them,” Qualley went on
plausibly. “I admit that I had a knowledge of
what was going on over there at that mill all the
time, but my connection with them was not criminal.
Roberts was very bitter against them because
he knew that his share of the business would
take him to the penitentiary if he were caught
and the wallop Mr. Burton gave him there on the
beach made him worse. I had nothing against
the boys and wanted to protect them, but I could
not let Roberts see that I did. Consequently I
pretended to be as bitter and bloodthirsty as any
of them. I saw them in the swamp there when I
was talking to Roberts beside the creek, but I did
not show them to Roberts. He would have shot
them there like dogs.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sounds fine,” Scott remarked sarcastically,
“but it’s a wonder you did not say anything about
all this when you met us on the train.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The public train is not a very good place to
talk over such matters as that,” Qualley answered
with dignity.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Qualley,” Mr. Graham remarked
good-humoredly, “I’ll have to admit that you are about
the smoothest villain I have ever seen, and I have
to admire both your nerve and your ingenuity,
but I am afraid you will have to tell these things
to the judge.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Qualley had not yet come to the end of his
wiles. “Wouldn’t it be better, Mr. Graham, to
get hold of the men who were in active charge of
this robbery, all of them, rather than to prosecute
one man who was only remotely connected with
the thing and let all the others go? I know where
those fellows are and can tell you just how you
may take them. Otherwise you cannot find them
in a thousand years. Promise me my freedom
and I will not only do this but will tell you all the
details of their crime. A clean sweep.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Graham gave him a look of unutterable
contempt. “No, Qualley, I still have hopes of
being able to find the others myself, but even if I
could not I think I would rather prosecute one
Judas like you than turn you loose for the sake
of catching the others.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Suit yourself,” Qualley said with a shrug,
“but let me know when you find the others.
That’s all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh!” Scott exclaimed with a grin, “I guess I
forgot to say that we stumbled on to the cabin
out in the swamp that Roberts had all stocked up
with provisions ready for just such an emergency
as this and I have no doubt that it is the
one to which Mr. Qualley referred when he suggested
that the rest of them should hide in the
cabin in the swamp till they heard from him that
it would be safe to leave there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps it is,” Qualley remarked dryly. He
had evidently exhausted his resources for he had
nothing more to say.</p>

<p class='c004'>After a few moments of silence Mr. Graham
came to a decision. He glanced at his watch. It
was a little after two. “We could call up the
sheriff, I suppose, and might be able to wake him
up in the course of time, but it would be a long
time before he could get here. So I guess you
boys had better go to sleep here and I’ll take this
gentleman over to the sheriff.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys protested that they were both willing
and able to finish the job which they had started,
but Mr. Graham would not hear of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing doing,” he said in response to their
plea. “I’ll see that you get full credit for all that
you have done, but I know from your account of
your adventures since you left here that you have
not had half a night’s sleep. To-morrow we shall
have to go after the rest of this bunch and that
may mean a pretty hard day’s work. No, I want
you to stay here and rest up. I’ve already had
about four hours’ sleep to-night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They recognized the wisdom of this advice, but
it was hard to miss the satisfaction of seeing
Qualley actually put under arrest.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Graham was soon dressed and ready to
start. He took the pistol from Murphy and
turned to Qualley. “All right, Qualley, let’s go.
You fellows see how hard you can sleep till I get
back. You may need all you can get, for now
that we have a line on these fellows I am not
going to stop till I have every one of them behind
the bars where they belong.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Qualley made one more try. “It might be
healthier here in the future,” he remarked, “if I
was not included in this bunch.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Graham turned upon him angrily and
glared at him for a minute. Then he burst out
laughing. “You must be losing your nerve,
Qualley, or your senses, if you think that you
can scare me with a threat. I thought that you
knew me better than that. Move along and I’ll
put you where I will not even have to think about
you, to say nothing of being afraid of you.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>It seemed to Scott that he had scarcely closed
his eyes when he heard the screen door bang
and Mr. Graham was standing in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, well,” he laughed, “still pounding your
ears? I guess you did not get even as much sleep
as I said.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott glanced curiously at his watch and then
listened to see if it was running. It was three-thirty.
“Thirteen hours,” he gasped in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Humph,” Murphy grunted, “that’s nothing.
I’ll bet I could do it again right now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Might as well try it if that is the way you feel
about it,” Mr. Graham laughed. “It’s so late
now that there is no use in our starting till morning.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, that is not the reason,” Mr. Graham assured
Scott when he noticed his crestfallen look.
“I’m mean enough to have called you at five
o’clock if I had been here to do it, but I just this
minute got back. The sheriff was not at home
and I thought I’d better escort our friend straight
to the jail myself. I did not feel as though I
wanted to trust anybody as slick as he has proved
himself to be to any sheriff’s woodshed for safe-keeping.
That is what the sheriff’s wife suggested.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There will not be any chance of his getting
word to those other fellows, will there?” Scott
asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, I think not. I impressed it on the warden
pretty hard that he was not to be allowed to
communicate with any one in any way. I hinted
that Uncle Sam was very much interested in his
guest’s welfare and he seemed to take it very
seriously.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wouldn’t it be a good idea to go down there
on the train this afternoon so that we would be
on the ground early in the morning?” Scott asked.
He was anxious to be doing something now that
he was awake.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought of that,” Mr. Graham said, “but I
do not want to take the chance. They might have
some spies out who would take them the news and
we would find the nest empty when we got there.
I am not afraid of their running away so soon
as this. You said they were planning on lying
low there for a couple of weeks. They did not
get there till yesterday afternoon, and they would
hardly be getting nervous so early. Just how far
is that cabin from the railroad station?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Must be about seven or eight miles, isn’t it,
Murphy?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“About that, I should say. I hope our swiping
that boat did not scare them out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“By the way, what did you do with that boat?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Left it on the edge of the swamp where we
landed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, it may make them suspicious, and it
may possibly have been the only boat they had,
but I do not think so. If they were long-headed
enough to rig up that cabin in the swamp against
a possible emergency like this I think they probably
arranged some pretty sure way of getting
to it and the loss of a boat would not be likely to
stop them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They had some boats over in the canal,” Scott
said, “because I saw them there. They could
carry them over there if they had to.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We cannot do anything now but hope, anyway,”
Mr. Graham remarked. “There is no use
in worrying about it. But if you fellows are not
going back to sleep right away I wish you would
explain to me the exact location of that cabin and
all its surroundings so that I will be familiar with
the ground when we get there. Are you sure
that you will be able to find it again?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t think there will be any trouble about
that,” Scott answered confidently. “We ran a
compass course straight north from it to where
we left the boat and while it was not a very accurate
course it ought to be straight enough to
find a house. I think that I can draw you a
pretty good sketch of the whole layout.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So Scott, with occasional suggestions from
Murphy, sketched the cabin and described it as
accurately as he could. With this sketch as a
basis Mr. Graham planned his campaign for the
next day. He pored over it for several hours
and it was not till some time after they had finished
their supper that he seemed satisfied that
it was complete in every detail. He then folded
the sketch up thoughtfully and arose with a yawn.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We shall have to catch that train at four in
the morning,” he said, “and if you fellows have
any more sleep to make up you better be about
it. I am going to bed now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So am I,” said Murphy. “I am not square
with the world yet by about ten hours, but if we
are not going till morning I am going home to
let my wife know that I am still alive. I’ll meet
you at the train. Anything in particular you
want me to bring along?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, nothing except a shooting iron of some
kind. You may have some use for that before
we get those other rascals in the jug.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s where I’ll miss my old Luger,” Murphy
said sadly. “I wish I had it out of the bottom
of that quicksand, but I guess I can manage. I
feel as though I could hit one of those scoundrels
with almost anything after the way they were
longing for a shot at me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>With that Murphy started for home and Mr.
Graham went in to bed. Scott sat on the porch
for a little while alone and thought over the events
which had crowded themselves so rapidly into the
past few days. It was only a little over a week
since he had been sitting on that same porch wondering
how he would ever accomplish what
seemed to him then the almost impossible task
which had been assigned him. Now almost as if
by magic it had come suddenly to a successful
conclusion. It would be an eminently successful
conclusion if they could only capture the rest of
the gang in the morning, but even if they did not
get them they had discovered their secret, broken
up their operations and jailed the ringleader. It
could not exactly be called a failure. It had been
a most interesting experience and promised to be
even more so in the morning, but he hoped it
would not lead him into any more assignments for
detective work. He had made good twice largely
through what he considered remarkably good
luck, but he was afraid that he might fall down
on the next one.</p>

<p class='c004'>He did not feel at all nervous at the prospect
of going under fire the next day, but he was
worried for fear Roberts and his gang would
not be in their hiding place. He felt that he
would always reproach himself with his lack of
foresight in taking that boat and possibly scaring
them away. Under the circumstances there was
not very much choice left to them, but he forgot
that now and thought only of the possible results.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, well,” he exclaimed at last, “we shall
know pretty quick in the morning and there is no
use in worrying about it now,” and he followed
Mr. Graham to bed. That gentleman evidently
was not losing any sleep over the possibilities of
the next day’s work. He was sound asleep and
snoring like a trooper. Scott soon joined in the
chorus and any one passing by the cabin would
have found it hard to believe that the two occupants
knew they had to dislodge a band of desperate
men from a fortified cabin in the morning.</p>

<p class='c004'>Had they known what was going on in the
county jail at about that time they would probably
have not been quite so contented, at least they
might not have snored quite so loudly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>In the county jail there was a madman, or one
not very far from it. As long as Mr. Graham
was with him, Qualley had maintained
his cool and indifferent air and had never for an
instant given up the possibility of obtaining his
release by some cunning scheme or inducement.
He offered no resistance whatsoever and walked
into the jail with the dignified mien of an injured
and misjudged man. In fact he told Mr. Graham
that he was sorry to see him following this
false scent because he knew that he was really a
just man and would some day sorely regret his
hasty action.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was so that Mr. Graham left him with no regrets
and an earnest request that the jailer watch
his prisoner with the greatest caution because he
was a bad one. He told him that on no account
should the prisoner be allowed to communicate
with any one on the outside because he was only
one of a large gang and would probably make a
desperate attempt to warn his friends.</p>

<p class='c004'>Left alone, a complete change came over Qualley.
His studied dignity fell from him and the
look of calm indifference gave way to a burning
glare of hatred which contorted his whole face.
He sprang to the window and watched Mr. Graham’s
shadowy form disappear into the darkness
with the look of a wild beast glaring through the
bars of its cage.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the last trace of the supervisor had died
away Qualley seemed to lose all control of himself
and became a maniac. He shook the bars of
his cell furiously, pounded the walls with his bare
fists and cursed till he frothed at the mouth. The
jailer came to quiet him but fled at the mere
sight of him. It seemed that, unarmed as he
was, he must break through those concrete walls
and iron bars by the sheer fury of his efforts.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mood passed almost as suddenly as it had
come upon him and he threw himself upon the
bed panting from his exertions. “Fool,” he
growled to himself, “where will that get you?
They enjoy seeing you that way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Calmly now he began to think over the situation.
He was caught and there was not much
chance of his escape. There might possibly be
some way out of that cell but it would not be by
butting down the concrete wall with his head or
biting off the iron bars with his teeth. If he was
to get out he must use his head but not in the way
he had been using it a few minutes before. He
was thoroughly ashamed of that.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first thing to do was to see if he could find
a weapon or tool of any kind. There were seldom
prisoners in that jail who were under a
grave enough charge to make it worth their while
really to try very hard to get out and the jailer
might have become careless. He began a careful
search of the room. The door was locked
and seemed to be in good repair as near as he
could tell in the dark. The bars in the window
were not very heavy but they were too strong to
break and they seemed to be firmly set in the concrete.
One of them rattled a little and the concrete
around the base of it seemed a little rough
but it was solid enough. The floor was concrete
like the walls.</p>

<p class='c004'>He dropped to his knees and crawled slowly
over the floor. There were only two articles of
furniture in the room, a small bed and a chair,
both of wood. If he only had a piece of iron and
they would give him enough time he felt sure
that he could work out of one of those window
bars. Even wood might do it in time, but he
doubted if they would keep him there long
enough. Nevertheless, it would be something to
do and something to live for so he set to work
to wrench one of the rounds out of the chair.</p>

<p class='c004'>The round came out easier than he had expected
and he tried a few tentative scratches on
the concrete at the base of the bar. It raised a
little dust, but he realized that it would mean
long hours of labor before he could accomplish
anything in that way, and there was something
else which must be done at once. He did not give
a rap for Roberts and, as Murphy had predicted,
would have seen him hung without so much as
raising a finger to help him. Moreover, he knew
that Roberts in a like situation would never have
done anything to help him. Just the same he
was extremely anxious to get word to Roberts
at all costs, not to save Roberts but to warn him
that the Service men would be looking for him
in the morning so that he would be well prepared.
If Roberts could ambush them and murder them
he, Qualley, would feel that his debt of hatred
had been paid and, too, he might stand some show
of getting free, for there was not any one else
around there who knew anything about his
crime or would be likely to prefer charges against
him. Moreover, with Roberts captured, he would
not stand any show at all. He very well knew
that Roberts would tell everything he knew about
him and would rather die than see Qualley get
away if he could not make it himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>So the first thing to do was to get word to
Roberts; there would be time enough for the
digging when that was done. Perhaps he could
catch somebody going by before the jailer was
up. He took up his position by the window and
watched patiently, but the jail was in an out-of-the-way
place and he heard some one moving
about in the jail before he had seen any one outside.</p>

<p class='c004'>Well, possibly the jailer was not above a bribe.
He had made plenty of money in the last two
years out of the logs he had stolen, he was rich,
and he could offer the jailer more money than he
had ever dreamed of. He waited anxiously for
some one to bring his breakfast. It was about
eight o’clock when he heard a door open somewhere
and the jailer himself appeared with a
tray.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Calmed down a little, have you?” the jailer
asked, eyeing him somewhat doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” Qualley admitted with a sheepish laugh,
“I lost my head for a few minutes last night. It
is enough to drive any man crazy to be popped
into jail on a false charge with no chance to explain.
It’s tough.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” the jailer agreed, “it’s tough all right
if it’s true. The judge will straighten it out
pretty quick if there is anything crooked about it,
but that fellow is not much on making false
charges, he isn’t.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, he has slipped up this time. Didn’t even
give me time to go over to the camp and tell them
that I would not be back for a few days. If I
could have given them a few directions it would
have been all right; as it is everything there will
go to pot. A lumber camp won’t run itself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe you will get bailed out in a couple of
days.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure I’ll get bailed out in a couple of days, but
it is the next couple of days I am worrying about.
Say, if I should put up five thousand dollars bail
with you, couldn’t you let me slip over there for a
day to straighten things out?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll telephone the judge and ask him about
it,” the man grinned. He seemed to think it was
a very good joke, but a glance at his prisoner sent
him hastily out the door, for there seemed to be
strong indications that Qualley was going to
throw another fit. But he managed to control
himself quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” he said, as though he had resigned
himself to the inevitable, “if you will not let me
go myself, send me a messenger and I’ll have to
do the best I can that way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can’t do it, Mr. Qualley. They gave me strict
orders that you were not to communicate with
any one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Qualley shrugged his shoulders and turned
away as though satisfied that he had done his best
and was no longer interested in what he could
not avoid. There was only one more chance.
Possibly he could attract the attention of some
passer-by and get him to carry his message. As
soon as the jailer had gone he took up his post
at the window and watched.</p>

<p class='c004'>All day long, with the exception of the few
minutes when the jailer was in there at mealtime,
he watched with infinite patience and still
no one came. The shadows were growing very
long and another half-hour would bring on the
sudden darkness of the southern evening. Gradually
Qualley became aware of a faint tune whistled
plaintively in the distance. It was the first
sign of life he had caught outside the jail all
day. He listened intently. The whistling was
growing slightly louder. He knew from the
plaintive twang to the music that it was a negro
and he judged from the sound that the musician
was on the road which passed beside the jail.</p>

<p class='c004'>Twice the whistling died out and he thought
the man must have turned into another road, but
it started up again, and after what seemed an age
a shambling negro hove in sight. It was at least
two hundred feet to the road and he was making
such a noise with his whistling that there was no
chance to attract his attention by any small sound.</p>

<p class='c004'>At first Qualley tried to catch his eye. He
waved a large white handkerchief back and forth
across the window, first slowly, then frantically.
The darky was evidently not interested in white
handkerchiefs. Moreover, he had already passed
the line of the window and would soon be wholly
out of reach. Qualley stuck two fingers in his
mouth and blew one loud, shrill blast. The jailer
would probably hear it, but he might not, and
there was nothing to lose if he did.</p>

<p class='c004'>The darky heard it and stopped both his feet
and his music. He looked curiously in the direction
of the jail. Qualley stuck the handkerchief
through the bars and waved it. Then he beckoned
violently. The darky caught the signal and
hesitated. On general principles he did not like
to get too close to the jail, but he evidently thought
this might be some comrade in distress and decided
to investigate. He ambled rather aimlessly
across the field, looking suspiciously to right and
left, and finally brought up close to the window.
Qualley recognized him as a man who had at one
time worked at the camp and the man’s eyes grew
big with astonishment when he recognized his old
boss behind the bars.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Listen, George,” Qualley whispered, “they
have me jugged here on a false charge and I may
not be able to get out for a couple of days. I’ll
give you five dollars if you will take a note to Mr.
Roberts to-night. He is out there in the cabin in
the swamp. You have been there, haven’t you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, suh,” George answered with suspicious
promptness, “I ain’t nevah been to that place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Qualley considered a moment. “Well, you
know Sam Clark, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, suh, I knows him all right.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you can find out from him how to find
it. Will you take it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can’t take it to-night, boss, but I kin git ovah
deah with it powerful early in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right. Wait there a minute.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Qualley scribbled quickly on a scrap of paper,
“They have pinched me. Coming after you in
the morning. Be sure to get them.” He folded
the paper and slipped it through the bars to
George. “That must be there by daylight,
George. I’ll pay you when I get out. The jailer
has all my money now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>George hesitated. He usually did business on
a cash basis. Moreover, he had known it to be
a long time before some people had gotten out of
that jail.</p>

<p class='c004'>Qualley knew what was the matter. “Here,
keep this watch till I can pay you,” and he thrust
his gold watch through the bars.</p>

<p class='c004'>George took the watch and Qualley settled
down on the bed with a feeling of comfortable
satisfaction when he heard the whistling start up
again in the distance a few minutes later. It
might not do him any good but he would have
the satisfaction of knowing that somebody probably
would be shot.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Mr. Graham had the conductor stop
the train a mile from the station and
they dropped off into the woods.
“Thought it would be just as well not to stir them
up down there at the station,” he explained.
“They may have some scouts on the lookout.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Day was just breaking and they heard some
wild turkeys gobbling over in the swamp. It was
a tempting sound, but they were after bigger
game this morning and held to their course at a
round pace. Mr. Graham had explained his plan
of campaign to them on the train and they traveled
in silence now, each one busy with his own
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott would have doubted his ability to find
that bateau, but Murphy was a regular hound in
the woods, and he walked to it as confidently as
though he were walking down a broad highway.
Now and then Scott recognized some landmark
and knew that they were on the right course.
He could run a compass line with the best of
them but Murphy never used a compass unless
he was surveying. When they came to the edge
of the swamp he glanced about him a moment
and nosed through the brush right on to the old
bateau.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good work,” Mr. Graham commented, and
handed him one of the two paddles he had
brought along. “You take the bow and limber
up your gun. You sit in the center, Burton, and
keep that rifle ready. Don’t shoot till I tell you,
but when you do, don’t miss.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The little bateau was quite steady with an extra
man seated in the bottom of it and the two expert
paddlers sent it skimming through the water at
a great rate.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Better get out your compass, Burton. Murphy
is pretty good, but we want a double check
on this.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Long before Scott thought they ought to be
anywhere near their destination a cabin suddenly
loomed out of the mist quite a way to the left.
He pointed it out silently to Mr. Graham, who
signaled to Murphy to stop paddling. Murphy
gazed incredulously at the cabin and shook his
head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is some difference in paddling with two
paddles and poling with one pole,” he whispered;
“but it does not seem as though that could possibly
be the place. Looks like it, though.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Graham thought it best to investigate and
they started slowly toward the cabin, keeping the
trees between them and it as much as possible.
There was no sign of life, but it was nerve-racking
work to sneak up on the blind side of the
cabin never knowing when some unseen marksman
might open fire. They stopped immediately
back of the cabin and listened intently for a long
time. There was no sound. Cautiously they
pushed the bow of the boat around the corner,
and Murphy, revolver in hand, took a peep at
the front. The others could tell from the relaxation
of his body that it was the wrong place.
They knew it long before he spoke.</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy slipped his revolver back into its holster
and resumed his paddle. The front window
was broken and the door was gone. There was
no landing stage and the whole place looked deserted.
Mr. Graham had a look inside. There
was nothing in it and it did not seem to have been
occupied for years.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Must have been somebody else in hiding some
years ago from the looks of this place,” Mr. Graham
remarked. “I could not imagine any one living
out in one of these swamps unless he could
not live anywhere else. Well, let’s make for the
next station. I hope we have better luck there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Once more they started on their silent way.
There did not seem to be any birds in the swamp
in the daytime. An occasional squirrel was the
only form of life except the cottonmouth moccasins
which seemed to be holding a convention of
some kind. They were gliding about everywhere
in the water and crawling up on to the logs to
sun themselves. Scott had never seen so many
poisonous snakes in so short a time.</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy raised his paddle and pointed ahead
and a little to the right. It was not very distinct
but they finally made it out. The hazy outline of
a cabin peeping through the maze of tall, gray
tree trunks and long festoons of Spanish moss.
There was no doubt about it this time. Scott
recognized the surroundings and he also recognized
a thin haze of smoke hanging about the
cabin. There was some one in it.</p>

<p class='c004'>A thrill went through the whole party and they
straightened in their seats with every nerve
a-tingle. No one knew just exactly what was
going to happen, but they felt sure that there
would be something and that quickly. Mr. Graham’s
plan was to sneak up on the place from the
rear. They could then wait in hiding till some
one came out. If they could cover one of the
party with a gun they might be able to force the
surrender of the whole gang without rushing the
cabin, which would be a very hazardous thing to
do. There was very little chance to take advantage
of any cover, and the attacking party would
be almost completely at the mercy of the garrison
till they could force their way inside.</p>

<p class='c004'>With this plan in view they sent the bateau
slowly and cautiously forward toward the back
of the cabin just as they had done with the other
cabin a little while before. They ducked nervously
from tree to tree like an Indian scout.
They were within a hundred yards of the cabin
now and no one seemed to have noticed their approach.
They were watching the cabin so intently
that they did not think to look at anything
else. It had not occurred to any of them that
some of the occupants of the cabin might be out
in boats.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly a faint sound off to the left of them
caught Mr. Graham’s ear and he turned with a
start. Not very far from them and headed for
the cabin was another bateau. For a moment
the cabin was forgotten. They all grasped their
guns and gave their entire attention to the boat.
It was manned by a single negro and he was paddling
leisurely. He apparently had not seen them
and did not seem to have a care in the world.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Graham was undecided whether to signal
the negro and warn him away from the cabin, or
to lie perfectly still and take a chance on his going
on without seeing them. He reasoned that the
people in the cabin must have seen the darky
approaching from that direction, right in the
path of one of the windows, and that to call him
to them now would be inevitably to attract attention
to themselves. He decided to keep still. It
seemed like a poor chance, but about the only one
he had. If he had known what the arrival of
that negro at the cabin would mean he would
probably have risked everything to stop him, for
it was the belated George with Qualley’s message.</p>

<p class='c004'>George stopped paddling every stroke or two
to see what time it was. Not that he was in any
hurry, far from it, but he was completely fascinated
by his new gold watch. It was probably
this infatuation which prevented him from seeing
the other bateau. He seemed utterly oblivious
of everything around him, and with another
long look at his precious watch he disappeared
around the corner of the cabin without seeing
them. They were near enough to hear distinctly
the voices which greeted him when he arrived at
the landing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Graham heaved a sigh of relief, and then
suddenly seized his paddle with a new inspiration.
These people would surely come out on the porch
to see what the negro wanted, were probably out
there now, and would be so taken up with him
that it might be the best possible opportunity to
catch them unaware. He signaled to Murphy
and shot the bateau ahead with all his might. He
went around the opposite end of the house from
the one the negro had taken and ran the bateau
close up beside the end of the landing stage.</p>

<p class='c004'>The whole party was there in a group on the
porch, five men and three women. They arrived
just in time to hear Roberts swear viciously and
angrily crumple up a piece of paper in his hand.
The negro was the first to see them and it was
the sight of his astonished gaze which caught the
attention of the others. The surprise was so complete
that for the fraction of a second they stared
open-mouthed and motionless.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hands up!” Mr. Graham commanded sharply.
“I have a warrant here for the whole bunch of
you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Roberts saw that he was covered, caught in the
open without his gun and taken completely at a
disadvantage, but he was desperate. He was no
coward and he knew that capture meant the penitentiary
for him. With a roar of rage he ducked
back of the women. The other men followed his
example instantly, and they all crowded toward
the cabin door, keeping the women between them
and those threatening guns. Roberts was cunning
enough to know that those men would not
run the risk of shooting a woman.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Graham was furious to see this opportunity
slipping from him through such a cowardly
trick, but he did not dare to risk a shot. There
was only one thing to do now. They must get
inside that cabin, for on the outside they would
be at the complete mercy of the gang and they
very well knew what that would mean.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come on, fellows,” he shouted, and scrambled
from the boat on to the landing stage. Scott forgot
his rifle in his eagerness and bounded up the
steps empty-handed close at his leader’s heels.</p>

<p class='c004'>The door was slammed shut, but Mr. Graham
thrust his foot into the crack and the impact of
his weight quickly followed by that of Scott’s
drove it inward and scattered the confused crowd
on the inside to all corners of the cabin. The
roar of Murphy’s gun announced his arrival and
a man crumpled out of the fight with a groan.
It was quickly followed by another roar and Scott
felt a streak of fire across his neck and the scorch
of burning powder on his cheek. He struck out
wildly and cut his knuckles on the muzzle of a
pistol, but he had spoiled the second shot which
tore some shingles from the roof, and he saw the
pistol fly from his opponent’s hand. The next instant
Roberts’ face, contorted with the fury of
an angry beast, burst through the smoke in front
of him.</p>

<p class='c004'>From the moment that Murphy’s gun fired the
first shot Scott had been fighting like a man in a
dream. The smoke and the gunfire dazed him,
and he did not know what to do. But when that
furious face broke through the smoke close to
his own he came to himself. He could not understand
the noise and confusion of a gun battle, but
he had had years of training as a boxer and he
knew exactly what to do with that snarling face.
He landed on it with every ounce of strength he
had in his powerful shoulders and the face went
back into the smoke as suddenly as it had come.</p>

<p class='c004'>The three women were cringing in a terrified
group on one of the bunks as far removed from
the shooting as possible. They evidently had no
idea of taking any part in the fight.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Graham had grappled with one of the men
and was writhing on the floor in the opposite
corner of the cabin. The two remaining men had
both gone after Murphy. One of them had
tackled him from the rear and attempted to pin
his arms to his side while the other was wrenching
the pistol from his grasp. Scott ran to Murphy’s
assistance. Just as Scott reached him the
man succeeded in getting the pistol and aimed it
pointblank in Murphy’s face, but he had to hesitate
for a second because the other man was directly
in the line of fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>That second’s hesitation saved Murphy’s life.
Before the man could fire Scott landed a smashing
blow behind his ear. The man crumpled up
without so much as pulling the trigger. The remaining
man let go his now useless hold on Murphy
and bolted out of the door. Scott left
Murphy to chase him and turned to see if Mr.
Graham needed any help, but he did not. He
had freed himself and was sitting astride the motionless
figure. He jumped up now and looked
about him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where is Murphy?” he asked, when he recognized
Scott through the coat of black powder
with which his face was covered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He just chased the last man out the door,”
Scott explained.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Keep these fellows down while I see if he
needs any help.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Murphy certainly did not need any help.
He was down on his knees on the edge of the
landing and was pumping the unfortunate man,
now at least half drowned, up and down in the
waters of the swamp. He seemed to be thoroughly
enjoying himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reaction was too much for them and they
both roared with laughter. Murphy looked up
at them and grinned. “Pull him out, Murphy,”
Mr. Graham shouted, “we may need him at the
trial.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy rather reluctantly pulled the man out
of the water and laid him on the landing. Scott
had turned from his glance out of the door just
in time to see Roberts regain consciousness and
make a motion to crawl toward his gun which
was lying on the floor near him. He sprang
forward and snatched the gun out of his reach.
“I did not expect you to come to yet,” he said
coolly. “Move again and I’ll fix you right.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I guess we have them pretty well
rounded up,” Mr. Graham remarked. “Now
we’ll tie them up.” He took a coil of rope from
a nail on the wall and proceeded to tie their hands
and feet. He tied Roberts first and then the man
he had choked so badly. Scott leaned over to
help him straighten out the man who had been
struck back of the ear and Mr. Graham had his
first good look at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Great guns, man!” he exclaimed, “you are all
over blood. Where were you hit?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott had been too excited to think anything
about himself. In fact he did not realize that he
had been hit at all, but now that his attention had
been called to it he felt the sting of the streak
across his neck. “It can’t amount to much,” he
explained apologetically, “because I thought it
was a powder burn at the time and had really forgotten
it till you spoke.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Graham insisted on having a look for himself
but was soon satisfied that it was only a slight
flesh wound. “Lucky for you, though. A half-inch
to the right would have cut your jugular.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The man whom Murphy had shot had received
a glancing shot on the forehead and was only
stunned. Murphy’s victim had swallowed a quart
or two of swamp water and was feeling too sick
to offer any further resistance.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Five desperate characters smoked out of a
stronghold like this and tied up without any one
being seriously hurt. That is what I call a pretty
good morning’s work,” Mr. Graham exclaimed
enthusiastically. “If those women have not
turned them loose again,” and he bounded into
the cabin.</p>

<p class='c004'>It would have been a very easy thing for the
women to do, for every one had forgotten all
about them, but they had not moved. They were
evidently too badly scared to think of resistance.
Roberts was lying on the floor with his face turned
to the wall in sullen resignation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The next question is, How are we going to
get them out of here? Where are your boats?”
Murphy asked one of the women.</p>

<p class='c004'>She seemed afraid to answer but more afraid
not to. “One of the men went fishing in it,” she
answered reluctantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, ho,” Mr. Graham exclaimed. “So that’s
it. Get on guard, Murphy; he’ll probably be coming
back pretty quick to see what all that shooting
was about.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They carried the man in from the landing to
get him out of sight and waited.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By the way,” Mr. Graham asked suddenly,
“what has become of that nigger?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Every one had forgotten him and he had taken
advantage of the opportunity to fade away. He
was already far out of gunshot of the cabin and
still going strong.</p>

<p class='c004'>They waited in silence now for the absent man
to return. They did not have long to wait. He
had heard the firing and hurried back to see what
all the rumpus was about. He had stopped at a
distance and watched the cabin for a long time
and not noticing anything suspicious he paddled
on to the landing. When his boat touched the
dock Murphy stepped out and covered him with
his revolver. He was too surprised to resist and
came out of the boat without a word with his
hands high over his head. He was soon tied
up with the rest of the bunch.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fisherman’s boat was a good-sized scow
and they had no trouble in loading all the prisoners
on it. They tied their own bateau on behind
and all three went to poling.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Too bad we can’t make them do the work,”
Murphy growled, “but I would be willing to pole
a scow a long way for the sake of landing this
bunch,” and the others agreed with him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>When they landed, the prisoners’ feet
were untied and they were marched
off toward the nearest railroad station.
The women, who had, of course, not been
tied up with the others, were given their choice
of going home or of going on with the men. They
chose to stick by their husbands. It was a queer-looking
procession winding through the old pine
woods. The prisoners were all sullen and there
was not very much conversation.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Graham attempted to be sociable. “Well,
Roberts, you certainly had us buffaloed for a
long time, but we have caught up with you at
last.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” Roberts snarled contemptuously, “and
if you had not stumbled on to that old chain out
there in the swamp you would never have caught
up with us. It was all Qualley’s carelessness.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Qualley’s?” Mr. Graham exclaimed in feigned
surprise. “Why, he said that he did not know
anything about this business.”</p>

<p class='c004'>That was too much for Roberts. He raved
like a crazy man and cursed Qualley in all the vile
terms he could think of as the leader of the whole
gang and the man who had persuaded him to go
into it against his will. Suddenly he happened to
think that he might say something to incriminate
himself and shut up like a clam. No further attempts
to get a rise out of him had any effect.</p>

<p class='c004'>They waited beside the railroad track out in the
woods because they wanted to avoid the curious
crowd which they knew would be embarrassing
for both them and the prisoners if they went to
the station. When the train finally came they
flagged it and arrived at the county seat without
seeing more than a dozen people. They turned
the prisoners over to the sheriff, who happened to
have come down to meet the train, and went on to
Okalatchee.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Graham had to go back to headquarters to
write up his report on the case. Murphy was
going home to take the good news to his wife,
and Scott decided to go with him. There was one
point in this mystery which had not been solved:
they had not discovered how the logs were taken
out of the pond. Mr. Graham tried to persuade
Scott to come back to camp and have his wound
dressed and get a little rest, but he promised to
get Murphy to dress the wound, which he declared
was nothing more than a scratch, and thought
that he could rest better after he had cleared up
the last point in the puzzle.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did you hear what Roberts said about stumbling
on to that chain in the swamp?” Scott asked,
when they were started on the home trail.</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy nodded. “That was what we heard
all right, but we never had the luck to stumble on
to it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“As soon as you have told the news to your
wife we’ll get out there and have a real look for
it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Murphy was as glad as any of them that
the thieves had been caught. “Now,” she exclaimed,
“maybe Pat will stay home a little of the
time. He has been living at that log pond a good
part of the time for the past two years.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” Murphy grinned, “and we are going
back there again as soon as I fix up this fellow’s
throat, which Roberts came so near slitting for
him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When Scott had a look at himself in the glass
he could easily understand why Mrs. Murphy
had been so horrified at the first sight of him.
The powder from Roberts’ pistol had blackened
all one side of his face till he looked like a half-minstrel,
and the flesh wound in his neck, which
was really a very shallow one, had bled so profusely
that his shirt was all stained up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Could not look much worse if I had really
been murdered,” he laughed, “but that scratch is
almost healed up now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is because you were so close to the gun
that the heat fairly cauterized it, but we’ll have
to wash it out just the same and put some antiseptic
dressing on it. These gunshot wounds are
very apt to cause trouble. Seems as though blood
poisoning follows them mighty easy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy soon applied a simple dressing and
they set off for the old log pond, which had now
acquired a new interest. The men, who had already
heard of Qualley’s arrest, plied them with
curious questions, but they put them off by saying
that they had orders not to say anything
about it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The wooziest thing about this,” Murphy explained,
as they walked slowly around the log
pond, “is that some logs actually went out of
here one night while I was here watching them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Were you alone that night, or was Qualley
with you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Qualley was there, too, but he was right in
sight all the time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did he stay right there with you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let me see. No, he did not stay right there
in the brush all the time. As I remember it he
went out on the logs once or twice and monkeyed
around there when he thought he heard something
suspicious, but, as I said, he was right in
sight all the time. Of course I did not suspect
him then and did not watch him as close as I
would now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t remember where he went in the pond,
do you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, I remember that, because he always went
in the same direction, always over there toward
the east side of the pond.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then I guess that is where we had better
look first.”</p>

<p class='c004'>On that side the log pond was separated from
the swamp by only a very narrow neck of land
which was densely covered with brush. They
made their way along this neck, fully expecting
to find a narrow channel through which the logs
had been floated, but there was no such passage
there.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have a hunch,” Murphy said as he cut a
long pole and made his way back to a point where
the neck was not more than three feet wide.
There he poked into the bank just below the surface
of the water with his pole and struck a hole
at almost the first jab. With a shout of triumph
he gave the pole a shove into the hole and turned
around to look behind him. There was a slight
commotion in the waters of the swamp and the
pole shot up to the surface some feet from the
shore.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But how did they get the logs down through
there?” Scott asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just like this. I may break my neck trying to
ride these logs without my calks, but if I don’t,
watch.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He cut another pole and jumped nimbly on to
a log near the edge of the pond. He poled it toward
the shore, headed directly toward the tunnel.
When the front end of the log was about to
touch the bank he jumped to that end, ran toward
the other end and jumped quickly to another log.
His weight on the front end had caused the log
to dip down to the opening and his running along
it had given it an impulse which sent it sliding
through the tunnel just as the stick had done and
it floated free in the open swamp.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Same way we used to duck them out of the
sorting boom,” Murphy explained. “Isn’t that
a slick trick, though?”</p>

<p class='c004'>It seemed little short of marvelous to Scott, who
had never acquired the knack of running logs, but
he could not stop to enthuse over it now. The
next thing to find out was what they did with
them in the swamp.</p>

<p class='c004'>They got a bateau from the camp and paddled
around to the place in the swamp where the log
was floating. “Right out beyond here somewhere,”
Scott cried, “ought to be that chain which
we are supposed to have stumbled over.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They paddled slowly on into the swamp, scanning
every tree eagerly. They had not covered
more than two hundred yards when Murphy finished
the sentence which Scott had begun. “And
there she is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They paddled swiftly over to the furrowed and
swollen butt of an old cypress. Hanging from a
spike about a foot and a half above the water
was a heavy logging chain. “So you are the
guilty party,” Scott exclaimed, as he looked curiously
at the chain. “The next question is, What
did they do with you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Murphy grabbed the chain and began to pull
on it. There was no give at first. Then something
on the end of it which seemed to be somewhere
under the spreading roots of the tree began
to swing slowly to one side.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Feels like an alligator from the way it is
swinging around in there,” Murphy exclaimed,
as he redoubled his efforts on the chain. Before
he could make any further remarks the thing
suddenly shot out from under the tree and almost
dumped them out of the bateau. It was a heavy,
tublike boat which had been caught on one of the
roots of the tree, and in it were all the tools and
materials needed to build a section of a log raft.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So that is the way they worked it,” Scott exclaimed.
“Now I see the whole thing. They shot
their logs out of the pond there at night the way
you did a few minutes ago. Then the next day
they collected them over here and made them up
into rafts. Then when they started for the mill
with a log raft they hauled one of these sections,
or maybe sometimes two or three of them, out
of one of those lower openings in the river bank
and hooked it on to their raft. No one would
be likely to notice just how many sections they
had. Then when they came to their canal down
below there they took that section off and no one
was any the wiser. Well, it was pretty slick and
it worked.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And now I think I’ll go back to camp. I did
not know how tired I was till now, that it is all
over and cleared up, I feel like going to sleep
here in the bottom of this boat.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come on over to my place,” Murphy said,
“and I’ll lend you a horse.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So it was that Mr. Graham a little later recognized
Murphy’s horse walking slowly toward his
barn with Scott asleep in the saddle.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>It was late in the morning when Scott finally
awoke. He glanced at Mr. Graham’s bed.
It was empty. He listened for quite a while,
but there was not a sound in the house. When
he glanced at his watch he understood why it was.
On the table he found a characteristic note from
Mr. Graham. “Sleep your head off if you want
to and catch up. I’ll be back this evening.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott felt as though he had earned a rest and
when he had washed the breakfast dishes he
stretched out in a steamer-chair on the little front
porch for a good loaf.</p>

<p class='c004'>The waves were lapping soothingly on the
beach, the line of islands still shimmered in the
sunshine on the opposite side of the lagoon, and a
little oyster schooner glided lazily across the picture.
It was almost the identical picture at which
Scott had looked with impatient eyes just nine
days before. Just nine days! That was all it
was and yet how much had happened since then
and how different everything looked now.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he had been a stranger in a strange land,
very much at sea, and wondering what he had to
do. Now it seemed as though he was an old inhabitant
thoroughly familiar with the country
and the ways of the people. And yet how very
little he had really seen. Most of his time had
been spent in the swamp and there were hundreds
of things outside he wanted to know about.
Probably the Washington office would get Mr.
Graham’s report in another day or two and would
wire him to return at once to his station in the
Southwest. He wanted to go back there eventually,
but he did wish that they would give him a
few weeks longer there in the South to look about
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>All afternoon he just sat there on the porch
and dreamed.</p>

<p class='c004'>About supper time Mr. Graham returned in a
high good humor. He shouted to Scott merrily
as he rode into the yard and strode up the little
oyster-shell walk with buoyant step.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, Burton,” he exclaimed, clapping Scott
on the knee with friendly hand, “I’ve just done
something which pleases me mightily, but it may
not be such good news to you. Maybe you have
had enough of the sunny South and are longing
to be back in the clear atmosphere of your Arizona
desert, but I wanted to see a little more of
you and I have been exchanging telegrams with
Washington most of the afternoon. Finally persuaded
them that it was absolutely necessary for
you to stay right here with me till the trial was
over and those scoundrels were tight in the pen
where they will surely go. What do you think
of it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scott jumped from his chair and grasped Mr.
Graham’s hand, his face beaming with happiness.
“The very thing I have been wishing for all afternoon.
It seemed a shame to come away down
here for such a short time and have to go back
again without seeing much of the country outside
of the swamps, but I did not suppose it could
be managed. You have certainly been kind
to me and I appreciate it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Kind, fiddlesticks,” Mr. Graham exclaimed
brusquely. “You’ve gotten me out of a tangle
with which I have been vainly struggling for over
two years, and I have only just begun to pay you
back.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And so it was that Scott spent three very pleasant
months in the little cabin with Mr. Graham
and learned how gentle, how courteous, and how
thoughtful a really big man could be without in
any way detracting from his strength. It was a
lesson he never forgot and it stood him in good
stead in the future.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before he left he had the satisfaction of seeing
the whole gang of thieves on their way to the
penitentiary under a fifteen-year sentence and
had received a personal letter of thanks from the
chief forester of the United States.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
